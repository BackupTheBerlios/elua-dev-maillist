Hi
   A critical aspect, from eLua's point of view, is the design of the
Lua interface to the module.
   Your aim of doing audio playback will probably lead you to design a
good interface for that, but remember that other people will want to
control devices by providing a certain voltage on a certain pin, so do
make sure it provides for that usage case also.
   You could also consider the current ADC interface as some kind of
model, just to reduce users' confusion, with its use of eLua buffers
in the model it has for dealing with more than one sample in a single
call. And how to set sampling rates. And for DACs with different
numbers of bits, which may be settable in software or maybe not... and
so on. Interfaces designed aimed at a single hardware and a single
usage case risk being ideal for that case, but awkward for anything
else (as seems to have happened with some of the other modules).
   If you care to post the proposed eLua-level interface here, maybe
we can make suggestions based on other hardware differences.
   On the topic of eLua buffers, their size currently has to be power
of two, which is less than useful for ADC and DAC as you can't say
&quot;process 1/100th of a second at 44100Hz&quot;. That limitation needs to be
lifted to be of arbitrary length... It's not ADC's fault, but needs
fixing in the buffer-allocation part of eLua deep down, then
propagating to everything that uses them.
