<PRE>Hi,

I have finally got elua built and working on my custom board (uses a
AVR32UC3-0512. It was a bit of a challenge since I have a slightly
unusual clock configuration. But that is sorted now. But I am not able
to get a console up over the USB-CDC interface. I was wondering if
anyone would have any hints or debugging suggestions.

When connected the USB device enumerates and shows up on linux as
/dev/ttyACM0. lsusb shows the device as &quot;03eb:2307 Atmel Corp.&quot;. I am
able to connect to it with a terminal program. I just can't send or
receive any data. The port settings are correct and I have tried various
terminal programs and also tried it on windows. I also tried forcing the
usbserial module to manage the device rather than cdc_acm but that
doesn't make any difference. Shell is ofcourse included in my board
configuration build file.

I am programming and debugging using an AvrDragon over JTAG. Using gdb I
am able to see that code is running and when I interrupt it usually find
it in 'repearstat' function, line 1035 of lparser.c.

The debugger continuously shows packets being received. Strangely after
each packet it shows a joystick key pressed event. I don't know where
this is coming from -- I don't think there is any code in there anything
to do with a joystick.

I have also tried spying on the raw usb data with usbmon and wireshark.
I have seen 64 byte data packets going back and forward when the device
is plugged in and when the serial connection is opened. However I
haven't been able to make any sense of these yet.

Any thoughts would be most appreciated. Thanks!
