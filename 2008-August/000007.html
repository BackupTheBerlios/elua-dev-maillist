<PRE>Thanks, Dado. Please see my comments below.

&gt;<i> Hello Bogdan,
</I>&gt;<i>    Hard to tell what's best now, as all your ideas will surely bring more
</I>&gt;<i> codeforce for eLua.
</I>&gt;<i>    Let's continue to maket it in ALL the possible fronts, until some of them
</I>&gt;<i> show up as more fertile comunities.
</I>My point exactly, except I don't know of many such communities. On the
other hand, you seem to know, and I know you'll do your best to
advertise, so hurray for eLua :)
This also affects eLua from a development point of view. So far my
strategy was to provide as many ports as possible, in order to involve
as many people as possible, even though I'd rather work on the missing
features than on the ports. This strategy might be wrong, I have no
idea at this point if this is the case or not. For example, I believe
that in order to be more attractive, eLua needs more platform support
(PWM (I can't wait to implement a TVBGone in eLua :) ), bindings for
ADC/DAC, I2C, event counting and others) and more platform ports. I
find these to be more appealing to potential users than &quot;bigger&quot;
features like file systems, built-in editor, TCP/IP and all the other
things listed on the status page. But again, I might be wrong about
this (especially on the TCP/IP part).

&gt;<i>    I would certainly continue to market eLua in the Lua list and Luaforge.
</I>&gt;<i>    Downhere, I'm also preparing (sync again !! :) to present eLua in many
</I>&gt;<i> instrumentation and electronic lists, from where we will surely get some
</I>&gt;<i> help.
</I>That's impressive, thanks in advance!

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    There will also be a big Control &amp; Automation event in november, where I
</I>&gt;<i> plan to prepare a big show with eLua and other Lua frameworks we have
</I>&gt;<i> downhere (not only for automation).
</I>&gt;<i>    With luck (and a lot of praying :), we can get some funds for your first
</I>&gt;<i> trip  to the tropics !
</I>&gt;<i>    Who knows ? Why not ?
</I>I think eLua is a bit too &quot;young&quot; for something like this, but sure,
if you can get people to be interested in it, that's definetely the
way to go.

&gt;<i>    Meanwhile, we continue to work hard here to get to where you where some
</I>&gt;<i> months ago :) We still don't have our own eLua running in our platforms :(
</I>I can understand that's frustrating, but don't worry, in the end
you'll see it was worth it :) Plus, the next platform will be much
easier to port.

Best,
Bogdan
