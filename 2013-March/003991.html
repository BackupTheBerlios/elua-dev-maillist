Good you liked! I been talking to people who already have use uIP with eLua
and they said that it gets confused and slow when it tries to open more
than 3 or 4 sockets, so, that's a big problem from point of view. At first,
we could provide only TCP functionality, but with no issues from uIP.
Extending to UDP would be a big step, but I think that TCP is more
important at the moment and then after we can think about how to extend the
net modulo to fit UDP features.

You had the SAME idea I had yesterday. Make luasocket compatible with lwIP,
that could REALLY extend the eLua network features.

 You said that lwIP could turns out to be significantly larger than uIP,
but I think that today our hardware is not as limited as it was few years
ago, either in RAM and ROM size, etc, so, I think that we could put lwIP as
a replacement to uIP if it proves it's better in many aspects.

About the license, good that there's no problem in adding it to eLua.


@Bogdan

Sorry, my mistake.. I said it's an evolution from uIP, but they  just
started being developed by the same guy, but not derivated from each other.

You really think that now, at these days we still have so memory problems
to room lwIP? The lwIP wiki says:

&quot;The focus of the lwIP TCP/IP implementation is to reduce resource usage
while still having a full scale TCP. This makes lwIP suitable for use in
embedded systems with tens of kilobytes of free RAM and room for around 40
kilobytes of code ROM.&quot;

I will try to start something, at least compile lwIP, since I really new to
eLua and the embedded world.


@Lukas Kacer

Please, share you us your work, as Martin said, could save a lot of time :)
I am really interested in :)


Best regards,
Gabriel
