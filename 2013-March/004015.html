<PRE>Hi,

i ordered the stm32expander some weeks ago and tried to find out nearly
the same questions.

The website of Omnima stated that elua is preloaded but mine didn't work.
- I tried to register on the Omnima forum to ask some questions -
registration deactivated, can't be used.
- I tried to write to the support (via contact form and mail) but didn't
receive an answer yet.
- I tried to ask here at the mailing list about the stm32 expander - no
answer (but that's ok, this list is not an official omnima help list)

My progress:
--------------
I was now able to identify the BOOT0 and BOOT1 pins on the expander and
used stm32flash to flash a new firmware to the stm32.

But be warned. The version Omnima mentioned from their google code svn
is not working (and can not be working due to the fact that the
sourcecode which is needed to do the flashing is missing).

You need to use the version at <A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/stm32flash/">http://code.google.com/p/stm32flash/</A>
That worked for me, doesn't mean that it is working for you.

I was then able to flash a new firmware but currently, i am not sure if
my created elua &quot;firmware&quot; is broken or my device is because it is still
doesn't work.
I can't connect to the UART port to get a working console...

Currently my &quot;interest&quot; at the stm32expander is really low, the
not-existing support of Omnima made me a little bit angry and i don't
think i will try to invest more of my time into that thing.

The stm32expander really looked great and before i buyed that little
thing i looked at the PDF overview from their website and looked at
their forum, it seems to be active - and is even mentioned on the elua
website as &quot;suppported&quot;. The reality seems different (but i can only
talk about myself).

Regarding to elua itself there is a really good documentation at the
website about how script &quot;files&quot; hand be handled in different situations.

<A HREF="http://wiki.eluaproject.net/eLua%20File%20Systems">http://wiki.eluaproject.net/eLua%20File%20Systems</A>

If i remember correct, you can also put a file into the romfs/ file
section called autorun.lua or something like that, that file is called
on booting the elua system.

Take a look at the src/main.c:

// Define here your autorun/boot files,
// in the order you want eLua to search for them
char *boot_order[] = {
#if defined(BUILD_MMCFS)
  &quot;/mmc/autorun.lua&quot;,
  &quot;/mmc/autorun.lc&quot;,
#endif
#if defined(BUILD_ROMFS)
  &quot;/rom/autorun.lua&quot;,
  &quot;/rom/autorun.lc&quot;,
#endif
};


Bye
