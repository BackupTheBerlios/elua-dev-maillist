</I>I removed all net module code.

The script execution is driven by events in the network. it's working like this:
Bind to network port is done in different script (or C startup code)
than the network read and write functions. The script with read/write functions 
is executed when new connection appears from callback function called from lwIP.
the only problem with this is, that you need to exit that callback function and return 
to lwIP to read more data or make real write to network. you can call lwip tcp_send()
but that data will be buffered and will leave tcp/ip stack after return from callback. To
solve this I do setjmp(parent); setjmp(child); child[x] = malloc(stack_size) before executing 
script and from in module.write/read functions I do setjmp(child); longjmp(parrent). 
this &quot;pauses&quot; execution of script until you get ACK from client on sent data or you
have new data to read. 

setjmp(child); child[x] = malloc(stack_size)  is creating new stack for lua script that 
will be executed. it's platform depended, but it is not something
hard to do. you just net to find out where setjmp save register with stack address.

it is a little bit more complicated I'm my code, as I have also matrixSSL between 
lwIP and lau script. And the lua script is in my case WSAPI, which I had to partially 
rewrite to C, because I was running out of memory.

</I>
Speaking from a developer point of eLua yes. But I wanted to know if he wants network
support for some specific project and if it's close to my one, I would be able to help him.

I know that a lot of users would love to see clients, servers, client-servers support and 
the best to port apps to eLua is luasockets, but I not sure if socket API is the good one for eLua and 
would not be much easier and effective to create just some kind of wrappers for lwIP.
From what I see, in actual eLua net module(which is socket based) is impossible to create server(s) unless 
you want to read with timeout in loop from all sockets that you opened. And in C code 
of net module you then do loop read until you read something or timeout expires if I 
remember it right. And as it is embedded system, we should care about that as
it can be problem for some users/devices/applications.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can't wait! If you can arrive earlier that is good, as it will maybe

</I>not sure if you/anyone should wait for that. I think now that your goal is probably
different from what my project does.  When I was choosing/creating the theme more
than year ago, I wanted to create some real value to the community. But now I see 
it moved to totally different direction and I'm not sure if it is wort of something 
(besides one fixed bug in matrixSSL api) and all I want is finally publish it == finish school
and get a real job.
