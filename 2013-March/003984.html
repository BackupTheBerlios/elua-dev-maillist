That would be excellent. I have found that uip is OK as long as you
send it a few bytes every noe and then, but if you try to transfer
data at the maximum rate, leaning on the flow control, it slows down
to 1 byte per second.  At least, I assume that's uIP. THe behaviour
was observed on AVR32 port, but I haven't been able to test the
behaviour on other platforms and no one replied when I asked about it
at the time.

&gt;<i> Other thing I have seem is that eLua net module is experimental, only

</I>
Well, providing the limited TCP functionality that eLua already
supports should make your task easier. Extending that to UDP means
having to invent more eLua-specific primitives in eLua's &quot;net&quot; module

Another direction to take would be to leave the existing net interface
as it is, and make the eLua interface to LWIP compatibile with
luasocket, which saves you having to invent an interface to UDP, ICMP
and the rest, is sure to be an interface that can do everything, and
would allow eLua users to use the hundreds of Lua libraries that
depend on luasocket.

On the one hand, it means taking on two projects instead of one, but
on the other it might be easier to achieve. Presumably, when LWIP
works on all platforms, either &quot;net&quot; could be reimplemented as an
compatability interface to luasocket (and probably in Lua!) or left as
yet another alternative-compilation-option, if LWIP turns out to be
significantly larger than uIP.
