<PRE>Hi Gabriel
  Thanks for your detailed feedback

&gt;<i> Before, I could not access eLua's shell because I was pointing to the wrong device, ttyUSB0 instead of ttyACM0.
</I>
OK thanks.

2 - It works!!!!!! net.lookup could resolve names and return the
correct parameters to net.connect :D

&quot;It&quot; == ??? -rc2? -rc1? Both? To find the bug I need to divide the
firmwares into ones that seem to work and those that are known to have
some problem.
I mean, I can test them here, but that doesn't mean that they work for you!

&gt;<i> I have built a firmware from master branch and it does not work, only the firmware you sent me.
</I>
OK, good to know you are seeing the same results as me. Thanks.

&gt;<i> What is the difference between these 2 branchs?
</I>
- The compiler (Atmel-GCC 3.4.1 on b.sm.it vs. my one built with ct-ng here)
- builder.simplemachines.it doesn't define BUILD_RTC so you get no
mizar32.rtc.*() Lua module, which was added since the web builder was
written. That &quot;should&quot; make no difference to net.*() but if it's the
kind of bug that corrupts memory at random, just adding one byte
changes what gets crapped on
- builder.sm.it is a 64-bit Linux, my laptop has 32-bit linux. That
should make no difference either! But I have seen that the Atmel
64-bit version generates binaries with 4 bytes more data than the same
32-bit version, due to padding a one-character variable to 8 bytes
instead of 4, and that would also move the rest of the data by 4 bytes
and change which variable get corrupted.
- something else that I haven't though of...

&gt;<i> I would like to help more if you need, be programming, giving ideas or reporting bugs!
</I>
Thanks. Do let me know if -rc1 or -rc2 show any bugs. I'll run some
more tests to see if I can find out what the deciding factor is. Of
course, I'm hoping that the cause is that my compiler works and
Atmel's doesn't but that's just my big-headedness ;-)
