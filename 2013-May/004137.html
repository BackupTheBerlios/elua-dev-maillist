</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Bogdan, can you summarise what advantages the &quot;new build system&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; brings please, and how this affects developers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As you know, I'm no fan of changes to a working build system to a new
</I>&gt;<i> and different build system unless it is the only solution to overcome
</I>&gt;<i> specific technical obstacles.
</I>&gt;<i>   For me, as an eLua developer, the new build system meant having to
</I>&gt;<i> make the same changes twice in two files in two different languages,
</I>&gt;<i> Python and Lua, hoping they remained in sync and having to test every
</I>&gt;<i> change twice in every build configuration instead of once, doubling
</I>&gt;<i> the work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This is exactly why I decided to give up scons entirely. Having two build
systems in parallel was a pain.


&gt;<i>   The new has no parallel build option, taking twice as long to
</I>&gt;<i> compile here during development, tripling it for testing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I know, but this will be fixed soon (hopefully).


&gt;<i>   In these tests with two biuld systems, I found that it generates not
</I>&gt;<i> only different code, but larger code, using the same compiler with the
</I>&gt;<i> same options. For my very tight 120K target that makes the difference
</I>&gt;<i> between fitting in flash and overflowing it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
We talked about that and I suggested that you check for different compiler
flags and different link order. If it's a compiler flags issue, that's an
easy fix. If it's just a question of the build order, I guess we could
change that too, but this feels like pushing it a bit too far. I understand
that you're working on a very space-constrained target, but depending on a
specific link order to make your image fit doesn't feel quite right.


&gt;<i>   Apart from the specific technical shortcomings outlined above, the
</I>&gt;<i> very fact of changing buld system has disadvantages to the eLua
</I>&gt;<i> program because it distracts developer time and attention away from
</I>&gt;<i> eLua itself, makes us maintain and debug two pieces of software
</I>&gt;<i> instead of one (since bugs in the build system are as much fun as bugs
</I>&gt;<i> in the compiler),
</I>

This will go away soon enough, once we switch to lake (because having an
eLua specific build system doesn't make much sense indeed).


&gt;<i> and it leaves incompatibility with the other 40
</I>&gt;<i> branches and 50 forks of eLua, which would have to (but will not)
</I>&gt;<i> rewrite all their changes to the build system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I might be wrong about this, but I expect that most of the branches/forks
that you're talking about didn't modify the build system too much; even if
they did, there's a high chance that only a bunch of macros/flags were
changed. If the change was more profound, I can help with the transition.


&gt;<i> Half of builder.simplemachines.it stopped working when SConstruct
</I>&gt;<i> disappeared from the master branch, the half that compiles the master
</I>&gt;<i> branch instead of 0.8, which is the only 0.9 option it has at the
</I>&gt;<i> moment, for users to have system timer, mizar32.rtc and all the rest
</I>&gt;<i> of the good new things in elua0.9.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The builder is indeed an unfortunate collateral victim and I'm sorry this
caused you so much trouble (our own builder suffered because of this too).
I'll do what I can to help you transition to the new build system. Our
builder was prepared to handle this change, but I simply didn't realise
that you have a builder of your own (I never used it myself); if I did, you
would've been notified about this change quite a while ago.


&gt;<i> If SConstruct still works, is it too much to ask to put it back at
</I>&gt;<i> least until I get round to fixing the SM web builder, which I didn't
</I>&gt;<i> write and don't know how to fix yet?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I will try to put the old build system back on a branch (for AVR32 only).
I'll get back to you as soon I'm done.

Best,
Bogdan
