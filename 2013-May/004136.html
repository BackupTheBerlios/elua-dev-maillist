</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Bogdan, can you summarise what advantages the &quot;new build system&quot;

</I>
As you know, I'm no fan of changes to a working build system to a new
and different build system unless it is the only solution to overcome
specific technical obstacles.
  For me, as an eLua developer, the new build system meant having to
make the same changes twice in two files in two different languages,
Python and Lua, hoping they remained in sync and having to test every
change twice in every build configuration instead of once, doubling
the work.
  The new has no parallel build option, taking twice as long to
compile here during development, tripling it for testing.
  In these tests with two biuld systems, I found that it generates not
only different code, but larger code, using the same compiler with the
same options. For my very tight 120K target that makes the difference
between fitting in flash and overflowing it.
  Apart from the specific technical shortcomings outlined above, the
very fact of changing buld system has disadvantages to the eLua
program because it distracts developer time and attention away from
eLua itself, makes us maintain and debug two pieces of software
instead of one (since bugs in the build system are as much fun as bugs
in the compiler), and it leaves incompatibility with the other 40
branches and 50 forks of eLua, which would have to (but will not)
rewrite all their changes to the build system.

Half of builder.simplemachines.it stopped working when SConstruct
disappeared from the master branch, the half that compiles the master
branch instead of 0.8, which is the only 0.9 option it has at the
moment, for users to have system timer, mizar32.rtc and all the rest
of the good new things in elua0.9.
If SConstruct still works, is it too much to ask to put it back at
least until I get round to fixing the SM web builder, which I didn't
write and don't know how to fix yet?
