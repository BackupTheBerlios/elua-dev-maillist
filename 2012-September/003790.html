<PRE>Hi Raman,

Glad to hear back from you!

</I>&gt;<i> Dear eLua community,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I trust you're all doing well. I have been caught up with university
</I>&gt;<i> projects
</I>&gt;<i> and assignments -- hence the long silence. Nevertheless, I still keep up
</I>&gt;<i> with the evolution of the eLua code base. Bogdan: Great work on WOFS!
</I>&gt;<i> I simply love it.

Thanks!

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have something to share with you all. Although this is not related to the
</I>&gt;<i> development of eLua, it very much works on the eLua philosophy and
</I>&gt;<i> code base. Literally - eLua is a philosophy for me and Lua is a very apt
</I>&gt;<i> core for it. But out of curiosity, I started playing with eLua code base and
</I>&gt;<i> replaced Lua with what my friends wanted to see -- a C interpreter on
</I>&gt;<i> Cortex-M bare metal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I looked around the internet and found the PicoC interpreter:
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/picoc/">http://code.google.com/p/picoc/</A>). I put it together (after several
</I>&gt;<i> modifications)
</I>&gt;<i> with the eLua base system. So now, I can write interactive C code on the
</I>&gt;<i> shell, run C programs from the MMC, read/run C programs from ROMFS --
</I>&gt;<i> basically, everything I would do with eLua but with PicoC instead.
</I>
You, my friend, are awesome. I already knew that, but this is insanely
awesome. Congratulations! I'm going to try this thing myself as soon
as possible. I'm really curious how it behaves in a limited memory
environment (I'm not worried about the compiled program, which would
obivously require less RAM than Lua code, I'm more concerned about the
compilation process itself). Plus, with us being able to manipulate
the code generation step much easier than you'd be able to do this
with GCC (whcih I imagine is the case), there are a lot of nick tricks
that one can perform, such as relocatable code (think loadable
modules), compile time support for debugging and so much more. I
simply love the concept.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, now, from PicoC, I could avail all platform functions with #include's.
</I>&gt;<i> For
</I>&gt;<i> example,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> #include &lt;adc.h&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> #include &lt;term.h&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> #include &lt;pio.h&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> .....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am yet to document the API but it mostly assumes eLua's format
</I>&gt;<i> for functions. For example, instead of pio.pin.setdir(pio.OUTPUT...) you
</I>&gt;<i> have pio_pin_setdir(OUTPUT...) (and similar for other platform modules
</I>&gt;<i> as well) in PicoC. Here OUTPUT is like a C macro and is stored in a rotable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also wrote a tiny (magic) RAM patch for this system. PicoC doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> have a garbage collector. So, for now, there is no way to query for
</I>&gt;<i> SRAM consumption at runtime (hence &quot;magic&quot;). You can tell the
</I>&gt;<i> difference between optram=0 and optram=1 only at build time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Currently, the system can be compiled for the following platforms:
</I>&gt;<i> LM3S1968, LM3S8962, LM3S6965, LM3S6918, LM3S9B92,
</I>&gt;<i> STM32F103RE, STM32F103ZE and i386. This can be compiled
</I>&gt;<i> with scons. The standard eLua's scons syntax applies here too (with
</I>&gt;<i> exceptions to 'boot' (not supported yet) and 'target'). The stuff I haven't
</I>&gt;<i> yet included in PicoC-remix is in the TODO list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please look for the code base here: <A HREF="https://github.com/witgor/remix">https://github.com/witgor/remix</A>
</I>&gt;<i> A friend is maintaining it (<A HREF="https://github.com/witgor/">https://github.com/witgor/</A>)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, I'd like to think of this system as an eLua distro :) -- a flavor
</I>&gt;<i> of eLua but with interpreted C instead.
</I>
I understand the concept, but I believe it is a bit more than that.
For quite a while now, people at PUC Rio have suggested that I should
split eLua into two parts: the platform interface part and the Lua
part. This would allow the platform interface to be used with other
projects too, which is exactly what you did here. I didn't embrace the
idea because I was mostly interested in pushing eLua as a whole, not
to maintain two separate projects, but what you did here convinced me
that their idea was right. This shouldn't be a flavour of eLua, but a
project with combines the &quot;platform interface&quot; (yet to be named as a
separate project) and your awesome (yes, I like this word) work with
PicoC. I'll take this into serious consideration and discuss it.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like your thoughts and suggestions on PicoC-remix. Please give me
</I>&gt;<i> a few tips on how to improvise on this.
</I>
Make it even more awesome! :) And please let me know if you need help,
I'm really interested in this.
Once again, congratulations and keep up the good work.

Best,
Bogdan

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best,
</I>&gt;<i> Raman
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PS: I really love the Mizar32 platform. I'd like to get PicoC-remix to run
</I>&gt;<i> on this. Unfortunately, I don't have the board with me yet but I'm going to
</I>&gt;<i> get one soon.
