Dear Bogdan,

&gt;&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/picoc/">http://code.google.com/p/picoc/</A>). I put it together (after several 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> modifications) 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with the eLua base system. So now, I can write interactive C code on the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> shell, run C programs from the MMC, read/run C programs from ROMFS -- 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> basically, everything I would do with eLua but with PicoC instead.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ...[show rest of quote]
</I>
&gt;<i> You, my friend, are awesome. I already knew that, but this is insanely 
</I>&gt;<i> awesome. Congratulations! I'm going to try this thing myself as soon 
</I>&gt;<i> as possible. I'm really curious how it behaves in a limited memory 
</I>&gt;<i> environment (I'm not worried about the compiled program, which would 
</I>&gt;<i> obivously require less RAM than Lua code, I'm more concerned about the 
</I>&gt;<i> compilation process itself).
</I>
Thank you! I had a lot of fun playing around with this. Please do give a
shot
at it. Do let me know how it works.

&gt;<i> Plus, with us being able to manipulate 
</I>&gt;<i> the code generation step much easier than you'd be able to do this 
</I>&gt;<i> with GCC (whcih I imagine is the case), there are a lot of nick tricks 
</I>&gt;<i> that one can perform, such as relocatable code (think loadable 
</I>&gt;<i> modules), compile time support for debugging and so much more. I 
</I>&gt;<i> simply love the concept.
</I>
Bogdan, I'm sorry. I don't understand the part about GCC. Can you
please explain this to me a bit more?

&gt;&gt;<i> Currently, the system can be compiled for the following platforms: 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> LM3S1968, LM3S8962, LM3S6965, LM3S6918, LM3S9B92, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> STM32F103RE, STM32F103ZE and i386. This can be compiled 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with scons. The standard eLua's scons syntax applies here too (with 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exceptions to 'boot' (not supported yet) and 'target'). The stuff I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> haven't 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> yet included in PicoC-remix is in the TODO list. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Please look for the code base here: <A HREF="https://github.com/witgor/remix">https://github.com/witgor/remix</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A friend is maintaining it (<A HREF="https://github.com/witgor/">https://github.com/witgor/</A>) 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Finally, I'd like to think of this system as an eLua distro :) -- a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> flavor 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of eLua but with interpreted C instead. ...[show rest of quote]
</I>
&gt;<i> I understand the concept, but I believe it is a bit more than that. 
</I>&gt;<i> For quite a while now, people at PUC Rio have suggested that I should 
</I>&gt;<i> split eLua into two parts: the platform interface part and the Lua 
</I>&gt;<i> part. This would allow the platform interface to be used with other 
</I>&gt;<i> projects too, which is exactly what you did here. I didn't embrace the 
</I>&gt;<i> idea because I was mostly interested in pushing eLua as a whole, not 
</I>&gt;<i> to maintain two separate projects, but what you did here convinced me 
</I>&gt;<i> that their idea was right.
</I>
Great! I have also started working on another similar project. I wanted
to have a Lisp interpreter running on bare metal. I got the Pico dialect,
played around with it and finally linked it with parts of the platform
interface. (I haven't put up the code so far - It's going to take a while
before it's usable) I would be interested in doing this as well. For now,
the Lisp runs on my LM3S8962 (and i368). I can't do much with it apart
from (load ')-ing stuff from MMC :)

&gt;<i> This shouldn't be a flavour of eLua, but a 
</I>&gt;<i> project with combines the &quot;platform interface&quot; (yet to be named as a 
</I>&gt;<i> separate project) and your awesome (yes, I like this word) work with 
</I>&gt;<i> PicoC. 
</I>
This would be a nice but as Martin said, how can things be done in a
maintainable way? What are your views on this? 

&gt;<i> I'll take this into serious consideration and discuss it.
</I>
Can you please suggest how we can take this forward?

&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'd like your thoughts and suggestions on PicoC-remix. Please give me 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a few tips on how to improvise on this. 
</I>
&gt;<i> Make it even more awesome! :) And please let me know if you need help, 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm really interested in this. 
</I>&gt;<i> Once again, congratulations and keep up the good work. 
</I>
Sure thing. Thank you Bogdan :) This has been a lot of fun.

Best,
Raman
