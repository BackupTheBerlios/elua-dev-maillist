<PRE>Hello all,

This is something I should've done quite some time ago: a coding style for
all eLua contributors. Find it below, and please try to follow it as much as
possible. Also, this is the first time I'm writing a &quot;coding style&quot;, so
please let me know if something is missing from the picture.

*1*. Everything should be spaced out properly. Examples (please note the
spacing rules, which is basically &quot;space out everything for readability&quot;):

i = 3 (not i=3)
a = ( a + 5 ) / 3
for( i = 0; i &lt; 10; i ++ ) ...
if( ( i == 5 ) &amp;&amp; ( a == 10 ) ) ...
unsigned i = ( unsigned )p;
void func( int arg1, const char* arg2 ) ...

*2*. Indentation: indent everything at 2 SPACES. Again, SPACES. *DO NOT USE
TABS*; this is important (and fortunately pretty easy to remember :) ). I
saw so many examples where tabs completely fucked up the readability of
source code that I don't want to hear about them again. Most editors have an
&quot;insert tabs instead of spaces&quot; option; use it, and set your &quot;tab size&quot; to
2.

Also, indent &quot;{&quot; and &quot;}&quot; on their own lines:

if( i == 2 )
{
  // some code here
}
else
{
  // some other code here
}

Or:

void f( int i )
{
  // function code
}

Do not enclose single statements in {} when given a choice. For example, do
this:

if( i == 2 )
  return;

instead of this:

if( i == 2 )
{
  return;
}

Also, follow the &quot;one statement per line&quot; rule. In other words, don't do
this:

if( i == 2 ) return;

Do this instead:

if( i == 2 )
  return;

Note that I'm not using a space between the function name and its parameter
list when calling/defining it (I saw that this happens in the Lua code, for
example). So do this:

void f( int i )
{
  // function code here
}

f( 2 ); // function call

instead of this:

void f ( int i )
{
  // function code here
}

f ( 2 ); // function call

*3*. Line terminators: *THIS IS IMPORTANT TOO!* Use UNIX style (LF) line
terminators, not DOS (CR/LF) or old Mac (CR).

*4*. Comments: I generally favour C++ style comments (//), but it's
perfectly OK to use C style (/**/) comments. I don't like automatic
documentation generators like Doxygen, since I think that they tend to make
the programmer overdocument the code to the point where it becomes hard to
read because of the documentation alone. I'm inclined to underdocument my
code; don't follow my style here. Ideally, you'd neither overdocument, nor
underdocument your code; just document it as much as you think it's needed,
without getting into too much details, but also without omitting important
information. In particular, DON'T do this:

// This function returns the sum of two numbers
// Input: n1 - first number
// Input: n2 - the second number
// Output: the sum of n1 and n2
int sum( int n1, int n2 )
{
  return n1 + n2;
}

If you do this, I'll personally hunt you for the rest of your life, or at
least until you give up programming completely :) When something is
self-obvious, documenting it more is pointless and decreases readability.
One more thing: we're not addressing to beginner programmers, but rather to
experienced/senior programmers, which is another good reason not to try to
overdocument your code.

Also, if you're using 3rd party code (from a library/support package for
example) making it follow the above rules is nice, but not mandatory. Focus
on functionality and writing your own code properly, and come back to indent
other people's code when you really don't have anything better to do with
your time.

Best,
Bogdan
