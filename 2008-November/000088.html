<PRE>Hello All,

&gt;<i> I am going to be adding I2C support to my STM3210 port this weekend so I

</I>

I'm having similar questions here too Mike :)
We're doing most of our (still testing) modules in C, because of efficiency,
both CPU and RAMwise but I don't see any problem in doing a lot of high
level (Lua) dev too. We were actually planning to do a version of my OLED
RIT128x96x4 display driver (actually a bind to Luminary's lib) in Lua, just
to prove the concept and test performance.

Also, do we have a platform interface in mind for I2C yet?


Not that I know but it would certainly be veeeeeeeery welcome !!! :)

Another question... What is the general idea behind how eLua is to be used?
&gt;<i> I ask this because it will determine if most of the low level code (such as
</I>&gt;<i> peripheral and chip drivers, and possibly some algorithms) will be written
</I>&gt;<i> in C and just the business logic will be written in lua, or if some of the
</I>&gt;<i> common drivers will be written in lua wherever possible. I don't think that
</I>&gt;<i> this would even be a question on a larger memory system, as RAM would be
</I>&gt;<i> plenty, but on a 64K system, ram is tight, so we should do whatever we can
</I>&gt;<i> to optimise for RAM usage IMO.
</I>

As discussed above, I think both models can be usefull and for performance
we will usually code in C.

My main reason for asking is, should I even write the chip drivers in lua,
&gt;<i> or should I do them in C?  The LTC3556 (PMIC) driver will be very small, as
</I>&gt;<i> it is a write only device and only has 2 registers.  The bq27350 (Fuel
</I>&gt;<i> Gauge) driver could be quite large as it is a more complex chip with many
</I>&gt;<i> registers and access modes, so more then likely it should be done in C
</I>&gt;<i> anyway...
</I>

For basic protocol and control drivers like this, where perceived
performance is important, it seems that coding in C will always be better.
But again, for RAD purposes and even for some real aplication, a Lua driver
could do the job in these fast little toys we have today :)

Anyway, I hope my questions make sense!


They surely do !!! Thankssssssssss !!!

Thanks,
&gt;<i> Mike
</I>

Best
Dado
