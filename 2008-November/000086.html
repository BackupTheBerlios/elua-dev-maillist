<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> I am going to be adding I2C support to my STM3210 port this weekend so I

</I>

Currently we don't have such modules, although there will be coming,
including Dado's PID module and my (yet to be written) char LCD module. I'd
put them in a &quot;src/common&quot; directory, with the module code still residing in
&quot;src/modules&quot; (we're aiming to give the new interface to both Lua and C,
thus the separation between src/common and src/modules).


&gt;<i> Also, do we have a platform interface in mind for I2C yet?
</I>

Nope. My experience with I2C is quite limited, but let's discuss an
interface. If you have a first draft, please let us know.


&gt;<i> My main reason for asking is, should I even write the chip drivers in lua,
</I>&gt;<i> or should I do them in C?  The LTC3556 (PMIC) driver will be very small, as
</I>&gt;<i> it is a write only device and only has 2 registers.  The bq27350 (Fuel
</I>&gt;<i> Gauge) driver could be quite large as it is a more complex chip with many
</I>&gt;<i> registers and access modes, so more then likely it should be done in C
</I>&gt;<i> anyway...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, I hope my questions make sense!
</I>

Your question makes a lot of sense, and the answer is: it depends. In this
case, it would make more sense to write the driver itself in C for at least
two reasons:

- it's quite easy to write it in C, and by writing it in C you take less
resources from the system
- you can also offer your interface to C programs, not just to Lua programs
(as mentioned above). Of course you can later call Lua functions from your C
code if needed, but offering a direct interface is a better choice IMO.

On the other hand, the scripting webserver I wrote for eLua is written in
Lua itself, which makes much more sense for a couple of reasons:

- it must execute Lua code directly
- Lua has very strong string manipulation capabilities, which was gold for
the &quot;scripting&quot; part

So: in most cases the aim is to write the modules/other parts of the system
in C, unless it _really_ makes more sense to write them in Lua.

Best,
Bogdan
