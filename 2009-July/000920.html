<PRE>I've just received this and played with it a little, but am just about to
get serious with working eLua onto it.

 

The device is utterly amazing value and is rather undersold on the web site:

 

<A HREF="http://www.ehitex.de/p_info.php?products_id=292">http://www.ehitex.de/p_info.php?products_id=292</A>

 

I was amazed to find it actually has a whole JTAG development
programmer/debugger as well as a very well featured target board and a full
PC based tool chain - all for 39 Euros on a USB dongle! (for some reason the
JTAG circuitry and connector is not shown on the circuit schematic). There
are actually two separate USB device connectors - the dongle one is to the
JTAG chip, but also routes through a virtual com port to the microcontroller
for application use. The second one at the North end of the board is
entirely independent and uses the USB interface on the microcontroller.
There is also full Ethernet with PHY chip, magnetics and connector AND a CAN
network buffer brought out on header pins.

 

On the minus side, only 8 pins of general IO are brought out to headers and
with the design of the circuit board and the very fine pitch chip it would
be virtually impossible to solder more. Each pin can be input, output or ADC
input and four of the pins can be PWM outputs.

 

Another minus point is that the software will not install on Vista or
Windows 7. However it does work nicely in the XP Virtual Machine on Windows
7.

 

Any tips on getting eLua on this? Should I fire up the toolchain under Linux
again or is it likely I can achieve this using the toolchain under Windows
that came with the board? Should I be able to get the Ethernet working at
the moment or is that still a work-in-progress?
