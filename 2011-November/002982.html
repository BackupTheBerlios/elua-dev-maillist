If you have a router handy that you can try plugging things into that
will provide an IP address on a private subnet (i.e.: 10.x.x.x or
192.x.x.x)?  This would be one way to double check any results since
this should work in most cases as a solution.

That said I'll provide at least a few comments here as far as
possibilities are concerned:
1) If you're plugging the cable directly from the MCU to the laptop,
make sure you're at least getting a negotiated link.  I think that the
MCU supports Auto-MDIX so the cross-over cable issue may be moot.  You
can use something like ethtool under Linux (as I recall you're under
Fedora?) to check on the link status.

2) If there's a negotiated link, things get a little bit complicated
in terms of Linux networking depending on what you want to do.  The
image I generated for you earlier will look for a DHCP server, which
Linux won't be running by default for you.  On Mac OS X or Windows the
&quot;internet connection sharing&quot; features can be useful to configure a
port so that a device that's plugged into it will see a DHCP server
and then have any outgoing traffic NAT'd automatically. If your distro
comes with some sort of similar feature that would allow you to share,
say, an existing other wired connection or wireless connection with
the MCU, it likely will work similarly to the feature on other
platforms (run DHCP + NAT), otherwise it might be fairly involved to
set this up. Something like this might work:

That said, I don't know how it will configure its routing tables or
what IP it will hand out to the MCU.

Using &quot;arp -a&quot; might be useful?

An easier alternative if that doesn't work would be:
Configure a static ip/subnet on the port being used so that they match
up with a similar static configuration on the MCU (so a static IP
image might be easier to work with).  This should be fairly easy and
is either doable through your distro's GUI tools for configuring
network interfaces or on the command line.  You can probably just
match everything that the MCU has for IP information except the actual
IP address which you would want to differ for the desktop.
Note: eLua won't have access to the internet through this configuration.

You can also bridge the connection that the MCU is attached to another
connection that would provide it with DHCP and internet, but this is
also not perfectly straight forward to explain how to do if one isn't
comfortable with mucking around with one's networking configuration
