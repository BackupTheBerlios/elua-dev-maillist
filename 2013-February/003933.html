<PRE>Hi Everyone

I normally write horrible and long emails but to try to avoid this... in 
a nutshell I really wish I could have been more active with eLua over 
the past year. I am spread very thin between my children's needs and my 
day time work.

I have a project that involves controlling scientific instruments and 
crunching data afterwards. In another nutshell I have had a hard time 
finding the right solution to the problems I am confronted with and have 
looked into baremetal embedded, RTOS-like embedded and desktop 
solutions. It now looks like all three together will be needed.

So to get to the point(sorry), SBC like RPI and Olimex's IMX233 are very 
nice but they don't have enough GPIO pins or peripherals for what I 
need. Baremetal is nice but sometimes it's easier to have an OS, 
especially when interacting with the user.

I was wondering if anyone has tried to link a SBC together with an eLua 
microcontroller? So for instance Rpi's 8 GPIO pins could be used for 
sending data back and forth to an eLua MCU such as a Luminary 
development board and Lua could do all the low level stuff.

Both the luminary board and Rpi can communicate over Ethernet and be 
linked this way but in my case it would be nice to have the eLua 
Ethernet port dedicated to instrument control and the SBC port used to 
communicate with the outside and possible hostile world. If this is a 
logical thing to do, is there a protocol you would recommend for 
communicate from a limited number of GPIO pins on a SBC and an eLua MCU ?

Hope everyone is doing great-Patrick
</PRE>
