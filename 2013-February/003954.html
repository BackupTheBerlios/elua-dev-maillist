<PRE>Hi Quentin,

I don't have any secret line to TI, but if you're looking for the
LM3S6965-IQC50 you're in luck, since both Mouser
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.mouser.com/Semiconductors/Integrated-Circuits-ICs/_/N-6j73k?Keyword=LM3S6965&amp;FS=True">http://www.mouser.com/Semiconductors/Integrated-Circuits-ICs/_/N-6j73k?Keyword=LM3S6965&amp;FS=True</A>&gt;and
Digikey have &gt;2K in stock (but they're a little pricey; other versions
aren't as available).  I found the NRND discussion at TI's
forums&lt;<A HREF="http://e2e.ti.com/support/microcontrollers/stellaris_arm/f/471/t/225466.aspx">http://e2e.ti.com/support/microcontrollers/stellaris_arm/f/471/t/225466.aspx</A>&gt;.
In that discussion, TI claims that the lead times issues aren't related to
the NRND status; I should note that we have a custom board using a TI
320C6201 DSP (introduced in 1997) and are still able to get it without
problems.

TI should have at least have some example code, since they sell the
Stellaris Serial To Ethernet &lt;<A HREF="http://www.ti.com/tool/rdk-s2e">http://www.ti.com/tool/rdk-s2e</A>&gt; reference
design kit, and it seems to come with some demo software...

&gt;<i> Hello Tony
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is interesting...where on the TI website did you find that the parts
</I>&gt;<i> are NRND?
</I>&gt;<i> Where on the TI website can you still order them?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the LM3S6965 is still available for purchase directly from TI then I
</I>&gt;<i> will order some more. However, the last time I looked under their Cortex
</I>&gt;<i> offerings no mention was made of the M3 family at all.
</I>&gt;<i> Furthermore, all the example code to develop a serial to Ethernet gateway
</I>&gt;<i> is just missing. I had the TI rep here, and he also could not find anything
</I>&gt;<i> online. I was also informed that a local company here had designed one of
</I>&gt;<i> the Stellaris M3 parts into one of their products. They are now struggling
</I>&gt;<i> to get the components and the lead times are excessive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Luckily I downloaded all the project files etc. a while back and I have 30
</I>&gt;<i> pieces of the LM3S6965 in stock. If I can get my hands on another 50 pieces
</I>&gt;<i> at a REASONABLE price then I will complete my design and wait for the M4
</I>&gt;<i> which is going to be released later this year with a MAC and PHY on board.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I understand things, TI bought out Luminary Micro. Rumour has it that
</I>&gt;<i> the parts were buggy and people had to base their designs around certain
</I>&gt;<i> revisions of the silicon or use the Errata sheets to overcome problems. TI
</I>&gt;<i> thus scrapped the range and their in house engineers designed the Stellaris
</I>&gt;<i> M4 from the ground up. So it is a completely new part. Personally I think
</I>&gt;<i> they purchased Luminary Micro to get their hands onto a few patents.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Looking forward to your response as I have purchased all the necessary
</I>&gt;<i> development kits and tools in order to complete my design. Now it looks as
</I>&gt;<i> if it is wasted money.
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe you can guide me in the right direction.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Everyone
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I normally write horrible and long emails but to try to avoid this... in a
</I>&gt;<i> nutshell I really wish I could have been more active with eLua over the
</I>&gt;<i> past year. I am spread very thin between my children's needs and my day
</I>&gt;<i> time work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have a project that involves controlling scientific instruments and
</I>&gt;<i> crunching data afterwards. In another nutshell I have had a hard time
</I>&gt;<i> finding the right solution to the problems I am confronted with and have
</I>&gt;<i> looked into baremetal embedded, RTOS-like embedded and desktop solutions.
</I>&gt;<i> It now looks like all three together will be needed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So to get to the point(sorry), SBC like RPI and Olimex's IMX233 are very
</I>&gt;<i> nice but they don't have enough GPIO pins or peripherals for what I need.
</I>&gt;<i> Baremetal is nice but sometimes it's easier to have an OS, especially when
</I>&gt;<i> interacting with the user.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was wondering if anyone has tried to link a SBC together with an eLua
</I>&gt;<i> microcontroller? So for instance Rpi's 8 GPIO pins could be used for
</I>&gt;<i> sending data back and forth to an eLua MCU such as a Luminary development
</I>&gt;<i> board and Lua could do all the low level stuff.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Both the luminary board and Rpi can communicate over Ethernet and be
</I>&gt;<i> linked this way but in my case it would be nice to have the eLua Ethernet
</I>&gt;<i> port dedicated to instrument control and the SBC port used to communicate
</I>&gt;<i> with the outside and possible hostile world. If this is a logical thing to
</I>&gt;<i> do, is there a protocol you would recommend for communicate from a limited
</I>&gt;<i> number of GPIO pins on a SBC and an eLua MCU ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hope everyone is doing great-Patrick
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What are your goals?  If you need need to get the project up and running
</I>&gt;<i> quickly, and money is available, then it's worth considering commercial
</I>&gt;<i> solutions (such as GPIB to Ethernet interfaces ($200 at Sparkfun) or GPIB
</I>&gt;<i> to USB, serial to Ethernet converters (boxes are available from many
</I>&gt;<i> sources, and modules from companies such as Lantronix and Wiznet), etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you want to do protocol conversion, or have fun learning, then an eLua
</I>&gt;<i> solution makes a lot of sense.  Although the BeagleBone has a substantial
</I>&gt;<i> amount of I/O, I've still seen people link them to Arduinos, so you're not
</I>&gt;<i> the only one thinking about combining various boards.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BTW, all the TI Cortex-M3 chips are marked as NRND (not recommended for
</I>&gt;<i> new design); they're still available for ordering.  TI should've handled
</I>&gt;<i> this better; normally chips are marked NRND after the recommended
</I>&gt;<i> replacements are available.
