<PRE>Hello Tony

This is interesting...where on the TI website did you find that the parts are NRND?
Where on the TI website can you still order them?

If the LM3S6965 is still available for purchase directly from TI then I will order some more. However, the last time I looked under their Cortex offerings no mention was made of the M3 family at all.
Furthermore, all the example code to develop a serial to Ethernet gateway is just missing. I had the TI rep here, and he also could not find anything online. I was also informed that a local company here had designed one of the Stellaris M3 parts into one of their products. They are now struggling to get the components and the lead times are excessive.

Luckily I downloaded all the project files etc. a while back and I have 30 pieces of the LM3S6965 in stock. If I can get my hands on another 50 pieces at a REASONABLE price then I will complete my design and wait for the M4 which is going to be released later this year with a MAC and PHY on board.

As I understand things, TI bought out Luminary Micro. Rumour has it that the parts were buggy and people had to base their designs around certain revisions of the silicon or use the Errata sheets to overcome problems. TI thus scrapped the range and their in house engineers designed the Stellaris M4 from the ground up. So it is a completely new part. Personally I think they purchased Luminary Micro to get their hands onto a few patents. 

Looking forward to your response as I have purchased all the necessary development kits and tools in order to complete my design. Now it looks as if it is wasted money.
Maybe you can guide me in the right direction.

Regards

Quentin

Hi Patrick,

Hi Everyone

 I normally write horrible and long emails but to try to avoid this... in a nutshell I really wish I could have been more active with eLua over the past year. I am spread very thin between my children's needs and my day time work.

 I have a project that involves controlling scientific instruments and crunching data afterwards. In another nutshell I have had a hard time finding the right solution to the problems I am confronted with and have looked into baremetal embedded, RTOS-like embedded and desktop solutions. It now looks like all three together will be needed.

 So to get to the point(sorry), SBC like RPI and Olimex's IMX233 are very nice but they don't have enough GPIO pins or peripherals for what I need. Baremetal is nice but sometimes it's easier to have an OS, especially when interacting with the user.

 I was wondering if anyone has tried to link a SBC together with an eLua microcontroller? So for instance Rpi's 8 GPIO pins could be used for sending data back and forth to an eLua MCU such as a Luminary development board and Lua could do all the low level stuff.

 Both the luminary board and Rpi can communicate over Ethernet and be linked this way but in my case it would be nice to have the eLua Ethernet port dedicated to instrument control and the SBC port used to communicate with the outside and possible hostile world. If this is a logical thing to do, is there a protocol you would recommend for communicate from a limited number of GPIO pins on a SBC and an eLua MCU ?

 Hope everyone is doing great-Patrick


What are your goals?   If you need need to get the project up and running quickly, and money is available, then it's worth considering commercial solutions (such as GPIB to Ethernet interfaces ($200 at Sparkfun) or GPIB to USB, serial to Ethernet converters (boxes are available from many sources, and modules from companies such as Lantronix and Wiznet), etc.

If you want to do protocol conversion, or have fun learning, then an eLua solution makes a lot of sense.  Although the BeagleBone has a substantial amount of I/O, I've still seen people link them to Arduinos, so you're not the only one thinking about combining various boards.

BTW, all the TI Cortex-M3 chips are marked as NRND (not recommended for new design); they're still available for ordering.  TI should've handled this better; normally chips are marked NRND after the recommended replacements are available.
