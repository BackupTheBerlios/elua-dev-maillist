<PRE>Hello Tony

This is interesting...where on the TI website did you find that the parts
are NRND?
Where on the TI website can you still order them?

If the LM3S6965 is still available for purchase directly from TI then I
will order some more. However, the last time I looked under their Cortex
offerings no mention was made of the M3 family at all.
Furthermore, all the example code to develop a serial to Ethernet gateway
is just missing. I had the TI rep here, and he also could not find anything
online. I was also informed that a local company here had designed one of
the Stellaris M3 parts into one of their products. They are now struggling
to get the components and the lead times are excessive.

Luckily I downloaded all the project files etc. a while back and I have 30
pieces of the LM3S6965 in stock. If I can get my hands on another 50 pieces
at a REASONABLE price then I will complete my design and wait for the M4
which is going to be released later this year with a MAC and PHY on board.

As I understand things, TI bought out Luminary Micro. Rumour has it that
the parts were buggy and people had to base their designs around certain
revisions of the silicon or use the Errata sheets to overcome problems. TI
thus scrapped the range and their in house engineers designed the Stellaris
M4 from the ground up. So it is a completely new part. Personally I think
they purchased Luminary Micro to get their hands onto a few patents.

Looking forward to your response as I have purchased all the necessary
development kits and tools in order to complete my design. Now it looks as
if it is wasted money.
Maybe you can guide me in the right direction.

Quentin

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have a project that involves controlling scientific instruments and

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> looked into baremetal embedded, RTOS-like embedded and desktop solutions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It now looks like all three together will be needed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So to get to the point(sorry), SBC like RPI and Olimex's IMX233 are very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nice but they don't have enough GPIO pins or peripherals for what I need.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Baremetal is nice but sometimes it's easier to have an OS, especially when
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interacting with the user.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I was wondering if anyone has tried to link a SBC together with an eLua
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> microcontroller? So for instance Rpi's 8 GPIO pins could be used for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sending data back and forth to an eLua MCU such as a Luminary development
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> board and Lua could do all the low level stuff.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Both the luminary board and Rpi can communicate over Ethernet and be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> linked this way but in my case it would be nice to have the eLua Ethernet
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> port dedicated to instrument control and the SBC port used to communicate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with the outside and possible hostile world. If this is a logical thing to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> do, is there a protocol you would recommend for communicate from a limited
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> number of GPIO pins on a SBC and an eLua MCU ?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hope everyone is doing great-Patrick
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What are your goals?   If you need need to get the project up and running
</I>&gt;<i> quickly, and money is available, then it's worth considering commercial
</I>&gt;<i> solutions (such as GPIB to Ethernet interfaces ($200 at Sparkfun) or GPIB
</I>&gt;<i> to USB, serial to Ethernet converters (boxes are available from many
</I>&gt;<i> sources, and modules from companies such as Lantronix and Wiznet), etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you want to do protocol conversion, or have fun learning, then an eLua
</I>&gt;<i> solution makes a lot of sense.  Although the BeagleBone has a substantial
</I>&gt;<i> amount of I/O, I've still seen people link them to Arduinos, so you're not
</I>&gt;<i> the only one thinking about combining various boards.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BTW, all the TI Cortex-M3 chips are marked as NRND (not recommended for
</I>&gt;<i> new design); they're still available for ordering.  TI should've handled
</I>&gt;<i> this better; normally chips are marked NRND after the recommended
</I>&gt;<i> replacements are available.
