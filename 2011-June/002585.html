<PRE>Hi
  I assume you all know about the loss of the elua issue tracker and
wiki contents.  I only found out today, a month after the event,
because I tried to follow a link in our documentation to the full bug
report and found that my username didn't exist any more.

  I'm writing to let you know that I've recovered from Google's cache
the short listing of all issues that were open on 13 May 2011. For
some of them there is also the full description.

<A HREF="https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmMtWGbjbm-RdGlfNS1OQi1vVHRCMVFHbGQtWmx2ZlE">https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmMtWGbjbm-RdGlfNS1OQi1vVHRCMVFHbGQtWmx2ZlE</A>

After half a day of work on this, I am now confident that this list
contains only the issues that were open on 13 May 2011 and that it
lists all the issues that were open on that date.

This has been a lobotomy to the project, made worse by the failure to
say publicly what had happened.
In the intervening month between the mysterious &quot;Is there anybody here
with good knowledge of MySQL and InnoDB&quot; and me finding out today what
happened through personal experience, then private mail, many of the
full bug entries have expired from the Google cache. Admitting your
problems publicly is good Catholic humility! Hiding them, to be
discovered later by other means, makes you look devious, secretive and
more concerned about your public image than about the project itself.
elua-dev are your friends, not your public.

This is a good moment to drop tracker.eluaproject.net and create a bug
tracker and wiki on elua.googlecode.com
They keep three full copies of all data in different datacenters, any
individual can download and save the wiki contents using Mercurial
$ hg clone <A HREF="https://wiki.mizar32.googlecode.com/hg">https://wiki.mizar32.googlecode.com/hg</A> hg-wiki
and it seems you can even backup the issue tracker contents using this API
<A HREF="http://www.softpedia.com/get/Programming/SDK-DDK/Google-Code-Issue-Tracker-API.shtml">http://www.softpedia.com/get/Programming/SDK-DDK/Google-Code-Issue-Tracker-API.shtml</A>
so even if Google goes bankrupt, simplemachines doesn't have to.
