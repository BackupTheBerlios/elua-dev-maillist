</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I tried building on Gnu/Linux Ubuntu, 10.10.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2.6.35-22-generic #33-Ubuntu SMP i686 GNU/Linux
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I only made a small change in the rpc-lua.py file to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; link with the ncurses library. There is no change in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; response. ./luarpc does not return the handle. Here
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; too, it just waits on the console infinitely.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Are you having to link in ncurses in order to get it to work?  I
</I>&gt;<i> believe that for most modern unix platforms just linking against
</I>&gt;<i> readline should work if a recent version is installed. On my Ubuntu
</I>&gt;<i> box I installed libreadline5-dev I believe and linked against that for
</I>&gt;<i> a readline library.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also just checked in a version that uses linenoise instead to
</I>&gt;<i> eliminate those dependencies. This should work fine for Linux &amp; OS X.
</I>&gt;<i> There's not a full port of that library for Windows yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All that said, I'm not sure if this would have any effect on the issue
</I>&gt;<i> being encountered, but perhaps something strange is going on here.  I
</I>&gt;<i> believe I have had occasions at least on Windows where the timeouts
</I>&gt;<i> don't seem to work correctly unless I have something within luarpc.c
</I>&gt;<i> or one of the lower level layers print something like a debug
</I>&gt;<i> statement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Am I overlooking any additional configuration that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is mandatory for the lrpc on my Linux box ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't believe so, but maybe something in the above might be relevant.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Awaiting your response.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the windows side, I did find an issue that was preventing it from
</I>&gt;<i> reading data, at least on my machine.  I'm not sure why I've only
</I>&gt;<i> experienced this with LM3S, perhaps it has to do with which FTDI chip
</I>&gt;<i> is onboard?  In any case by not setting the DTR control to disabled,
</I>&gt;<i> and just leaving it in its default state (whatever that might be) it
</I>&gt;<i> now works for me on Windows XP 32-bit:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> C:\elua&gt;luarpc test\test-rpc.lua
</I>&gt;<i> Platform: LM3S
</I>&gt;<i> CPU: LM3S6965
</I>&gt;<i> Board: EK-LM3S6965
</I>&gt;<i> CPU Clock: 50 MHz
</I>&gt;<i> Memory Used: 10.009765625 kB
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I finally narrowed it down by a simple test program in C that just
</I>&gt;<i> sent the 9 byte opening sequence and then tried to read the 8 byte
</I>&gt;<i> header back.  Since I found this worked, I then started removing
</I>&gt;<i> things that weren't in this test setup from serial_win32 until I found
</I>&gt;<i> that applying this one setting ( dcb.fDtrControl =
</I>&gt;<i> DTR_CONTROL_DISABLE; ) would even prevent the test program from
</I>&gt;<i> successfully running until I had unplugged/replugged the USB
</I>&gt;<i> interface.  I'm guessing that for some reason, even though the DTR
</I>&gt;<i> line wouldn't even be used in this case, changing its state is messing
</I>&gt;<i> something up or maybe it's having the opposite effect of disabling
</I>&gt;<i> DTR?  Some more investigation is warranted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This leads me to another question for others on the list: has anyone
</I>&gt;<i> been using either luarpc, mux or rfs with LM3S boards successfully
</I>&gt;<i> prior to this fix?  Bogdan, have you tried RFS or mux with an LM3S
</I>&gt;<i> eval kit using the onboard FTDI JTAG/UART for a serial interface?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Nope, never. This is very weird though, DTR_CONTROL_DISABLE always worked
for me in the RFS server (I can't remember if I tested it with LM3S under
Windows though). This might have something to do with the combined JTAG/UART
interface that you're talking about, I have no idea how that is implemented
internally. Glad it works, although I'm not sure that letting fDtrControl
have whatever value it gets from the system is a good idea. Not that I have
a better one :)


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Raman
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A dmsg gave me the following information.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; usb 8-1: Detected FT2232C
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; usb 8-1: Number of endpoints 2
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; usb 8-1: Endpoint 1 MaxPacketSize 64
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; usb 8-1: Endpoint 2 MaxPacketSize 64
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; usb 8-1: Setting MaxPacketSize 64
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; usb 8-1: FTDI USB Serial Device converter now attached to ttyUSB0
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This was on Ubuntu, 10.10, i686, Kernel: 2.6.35-xx
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This was not displayed. So, ftdi_sio was not registered.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [10211.358498] usbcore: registered new interface driver ftdi_sio
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [10211.358500] ftdi_sio: v1.6.0:USB FTDI Serial Converters Driver
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am not sure why this is not happening, but is there a conclusion we can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; draw ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It may be that it's just not printing the same information to the logs
</I>&gt;<i> with the version of Ubuntu you're running.    I can't imagine it's not
</I>&gt;<i> running that driver since I think that provides the virtual UART
</I>&gt;<i> functionality.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Exactly. Since it's printing &quot;FTDI USB Serial Device converter now attached
to ttyUSB0&quot; you can be sure that the driver is there.

Best,
Bogdan
