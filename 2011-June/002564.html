OK, so I have to admit that I haven't followed every twist and turn of
this, nor have I looked at the NXP hardware or driver implementation
that you're discussing suggestions about below, but it strikes me that
if we're going to have to bitbang i2c in order to make the eLua API
work with the hardware modules on more than one platform then the API
has got to change.  Maybe what we should do in that situation is to
branch it out into some sort of &quot;restricted&quot; and a &quot;low level&quot; API,
I'm not sure.

It sounded like some of the differences of opinion were around the
idea of being able to read and write in chunks rather than doing it as
a one-shot operation. The issue is that platforms like AVR32 can't do
the chunked operations since the hardware expects the transaction to
be described upfront?

The read and write functions could probably work in both modes, with
passed parameters indicating that the transaction shouldn't be closed
yet or something similar?  For platforms that don't support this as an
option, and this would be documented as well, would return an error
indicating that it's not a supported capability.  We already have some
precedent for this in the sense that for things like ADC only certain
timers (or none) can be used as trigger sources.  This functionality
could be referred to as &quot;extended&quot; i2c support or something similar?
Riffing on bogdan's example, maybe something like this:

write( id, address, data, len, send_stop )
read( id, address, data, len, send_stop )

Where in this case send_stop is an optional parameter only supported
for platforms where one can do an open-ended transaction, this would
lead to a model like this for such multi-stage:
write( id, address, data, len, 0 ) -- trying to not send a stop would
give an error on platforms like avr32
write( id, -1, data, len, 0 ) -- repeat as needed, passing -1, or
maybe nil in Lua indicates not to try sending the address again
(attempting to call write with a non-valid address on non-&quot;extended&quot;
platforms would result in an error
write( id, -1, data, len, 1 ) -- end

In lua the stop parameter could be an optional one, again specifically
labelled as being part of &quot;extended&quot; support.

I would generally be a fan of encapsulating as much functionality into
a given Lua function call as possible anyways since looping and
iterating in C code is much cheaper than looping in Lua.  I don't
hugely like having separate functions to spit the address out on the
bus etc since that's yet more byte code that has to be executed every
time the user starts an i2c operation.

Does that seem more reasonable or have I missed part of this?

&gt;<i> It also saves me from either having to
</I>&gt;<i> convince Bogdan to be sensible, or having to make and maintain an
</I>&gt;<i> incompatible fork of eLua, both of which are much more painful.
</I>
I lost track of this discussion a little.  I think that as a bottom
line the API should be able to degrade well enough to work with the
hardware that's available while incorporating a useful feature set for
a high level language (reducing the amount of bytecode that has to be
churned to get a task done, plus providing a reasonably friendly API).
At the same time, I don't think the API has to be perfect, just useful
for most of the cases where it is applied, unambiguous about what it's
doing and just attractive enough so that when people look at it they
think about getting use out of it rather than how ugly it is (there's
more to it than these, but I think these are relevant to this case). I
probably should have jumped in here and dug into more of the details
to try and help hash this out a bit better, but I've been running a
bit low on time and felt like reading up a bit on the platform and i2c
spec before chiming in again.

If we can, lets take this a few steps back and focus on hashing out
something that will work for all of us.

Best.
