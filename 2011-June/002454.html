True.  I just meant they probably had been abused a little and maybe
therefore could cover a variety of use cases.

&gt;<i> In fact, they are all totally different:

</I>
Well, except for the separate address command.  If you look at the
usage example the read and write take the address, and length of
command as well.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/Wire">http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/Wire</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> bizarre.
</I>
Kind of agree here, mentioned it though since it is the poster child
hobbyist microcontroller platform and it has been replicated onto
other platforms other than the 8-bit AVR now.  That said I prefer the
mbed one to it.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://labdasar.ee.itb.ac.id/lab/installer/embedded/ecos-3.0.cygwin/ecos-3.0/doc/html/ref/i2c-api.html">http://labdasar.ee.itb.ac.id/lab/installer/embedded/ecos-3.0.cygwin/ecos-3.0/doc/html/ref/i2c-api.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Two functions:
</I>&gt;<i> uint32 cyg_i2c_tx(const cyg_i2c_device* device, const cyg_uint8*
</I>&gt;<i> tx_data, cyg_uint32 count)
</I>&gt;<i> uint32 cyg_i2c_rx(const cyg_i2c_device* device, cyg_uint8* rx_data,
</I>&gt;<i> cyg_uint32 count);
</I>&gt;<i> where cyg_i2c_device encodes &quot;which i2c bus&quot;, &quot;slave address&quot; and &quot;speed&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> looks like the closest yet... until you try to do a write-read
</I>&gt;<i> combined message. Then you have to use a different, big hairy
</I>&gt;<i> transaction-oriented interface, because the &quot;simple&quot; interface above
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't allow tx-rx without an intervening stop.
</I>
Right, this actually also looks fairly close to one of the models
supported by mbed.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://code.bsd64.org/browse/freebsd/RELENG_8_0/src/sys/dev/iicbus/iic.h">http://code.bsd64.org/browse/freebsd/RELENG_8_0/src/sys/dev/iicbus/iic.h</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> start, stop, read, write, rdwr(?), and repeated-start. &#160;Again, too
</I>&gt;<i> low-level for high level hardware
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> eLua's platform C API can also be a bit lower level than the Lua API
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as well in case some commands might need to be bundled together for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> efficiency/timing purposes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, I need to keep the whole I2C message, including a combined
</I>&gt;<i> write-read sequence, intact down to the platform level, otherwise the
</I>&gt;<i> hardware generates a STOP automatically if the read request doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> arrive in time.
</I>&gt;<i> If your basic primitives are start() stop() readbyte() writebyte(),
</I>&gt;<i> the higher level description can easily be implemented in terms of
</I>&gt;<i> them. &#160;But if the platform interface is at a lower level than this, it
</I>&gt;<i> is quite difficlt to reconstruct the original combined message by
</I>&gt;<i> spotting a special sequence of starts, tx and rx messages. &#160;You would
</I>&gt;<i> still end up having to buffer everything from the start to the first
</I>&gt;<i> stop and then performing the whole operation at that time.
</I>
I think I understand this better having read some of the additional
messages from you and Bogdan about how the different hardware
implementations are somewhat bizarre in automating or requiring
certain behaviors and timings. *sigh*

In light of this it sounds like the eLua and C APIs might need to be
fairly high level, leaving the platform variability to the hardware
platform and driver.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Perhaps we could aim for keeping things
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fairly generic, simple and atomic at the platform C API level
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of these words I think understand &quot;atomic&quot;: it means &quot;a single
</I>&gt;<i> operation that either completes in its entirety or doesn't happen at
</I>&gt;<i> all&quot;, which suggests keeping entire I2C messages as single objects all
</I>&gt;<i> the way down.
</I>
Simple/single all or nothing operations that don't do more than they
have to, minimizing side effects.  I think what I was envisioning for
this originally wasn't quite right, but what you're saying here
probably sounds about right.  Keep the entire message as a single
object or transaction all the way down and report associated
error/status messages (ACK/NACK) as necessary if the attempt fails at
some stage.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;and then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> perhaps provide some convenience or group some operations within the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> higher level Lua API?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Some of them include
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> semantics (like arduino) to use send to queue messages and then send
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> them when the transmission is ended, then ACK/NACK status is returned.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Exactly what I was hoping to avoid, since you have to copy and buffer
</I>&gt;<i> a potentially infinite amount of data, then send it when they say
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;stop&quot;, which means you have to be able to allocate arbitrary amounts
</I>&gt;<i> of memory inside the device driver.
</I>
Yeah, I don't think this is a great idea either.  Although as with the
single operation, you could return an error on the queuing telling the
user that the message or buffer is too long. What I dislike more
however is making some separate state object to keep track of in
between queuing operations that is inconsistent with how the rest of
eLua behaves for modules like this.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> FWIW: I'm not too concerned about running in slave mode either at this point.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Nor am I personally, but if we are designing a world-class API that
</I>&gt;<i> will be with eLua forever, maybe thinking about it would be a good
</I>&gt;<i> idea at this point.
</I>
Indeed.  I think we should plan for it in the API, I'm just not as
worried about getting that tested and implemented on all platforms at
this stage.  I'm not sure if that makes it difficult to design in or
not :-)

&gt;<i> &#160;I gather that the buttons on the Mizar32 LCD
</I>&gt;<i> display are supposed to work in master mode with the AVR32 SoC as
</I>&gt;<i> slave so that you don't have to do busy-wait polling to detect button
</I>&gt;<i> presses (you prod the button-controlling PIC, go into slave mode and
</I>&gt;<i> then wait for the buttons to poke you). &#160;However, this may just be a
</I>&gt;<i> case of poor design, and the LCD/button hardware module is not one of
</I>&gt;<i> those scheduled to be ready for the initial product release, so we can
</I>&gt;<i> still review its design.
</I>
I'm not sure how common the use case is for slave mode.  Based on
looking at some of the APIs mentioned previously it sounds like it
wouldn't be terribly hard to incorporate the functionality.  As for
Mizar32's use of it, that's another matter :-)
