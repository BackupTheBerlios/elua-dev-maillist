<PRE>Hi Dado,

2011/6/28 Dado Sutter &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/elua-dev">dadosutter at gmail.com</A>&gt;
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  I only found out today, a month after the event,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because I tried to follow a link in our documentation to the full bug
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> report and found that my username didn't exist any more.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not exactly. You found today that your (actually all) username/password was
</I>&gt;<i> not valid and I explained you needed to register again, after what I raised
</I>&gt;<i> your status to &quot;developer&quot; on the projects and informed you privately.
</I>&gt;<i> During the weeks that the tracker was offline, there was a message online
</I>&gt;<i> explaining what has happened and as I received a large number of pvt
</I>&gt;<i> messages, I thought that tracker users were aware of this. I also remember
</I>&gt;<i> mentioning this to Sergio and I (possibly wrongly) assumed he would inform
</I>&gt;<i> your Team.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, i remember perfectly, you told me (like i think you did with all the
others devs privately) of the lost Servers for the Flood
damage. Unfortunately i didn't advised Martin of the happening at that time
i was too easy thinking you advised him already.

Pls accept my apologize.

We all know your personal and your team effort. We think that eLua is a
winning project and with a bright future, near to become mature and we did't
invest so much in it if we had another view. We only ask the possibility to
contribute and put our minds to improve it where needed. And yes we are all
man, not machine, each one of us with its caracter, extreme sometime, but we
wrong if we considerate Martin's excessive criticism a bad thing.
Collaborative work is important, sometime is preferred more moderation and
less technical skill, sometime not, i prefer flexibilty. I Personally hope
that many and many skilled developers fall in the project and the developing
method become more and more bottom up and less top down, of course a
coordination is very important.

We should be all friends here,
is very nice to have same passion with part of our path that become common.

Sergio
