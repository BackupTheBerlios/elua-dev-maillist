The current implementation of i2c.write( id, data1, [data2], [data3],
... ) relies on this, yes, but that's going to have to be rewritten
too.  If you want to take a variable number of parameters in the new
i2c.send(), you'll have to concatenate their values into a Lua buffer
before calling the C platform interface with the whole data packet.
In fact, that might be a good feature to keep, making it easier for
users to construct structured I2C data packets.
Keep that thought in mind a moment...

Anyway, AVR32 cannot write data without an address; the hardware can
only handles complete I2C packets, so that's that.
If you go back to function calls that write half an I2C packet, the
AVR32 is going to have to collect them up until it gets a stop and
then send them all.  That means being able to allocate arbitrary
amounts of RAM in the C device driver, which I don't think is
desirable.

Furthermore, if you make the C platform interface deal only in whole
I2C packets, you can be sure to be able to implement I2C on other
future hardware platforms that also only deal in complete I2C packets.
AVR32 is just the first example we have found that needs this.

&gt;<i> If we do chunked reads (read_from_address followed by read) we

</I>
Yuck!  Why would you want to read half a response?

&gt;<i> After an EEPROM receives the data to
</I>&gt;<i> write it needs some time to write it, during this time it will not be
</I>&gt;<i> accesible and it will not ACK its device address.
</I>
Hmm.  Well, once you define the eeprom-reading and eeprom-writing
functions in Lua on top of the I2C module, you can move the check
there.  Assuming you have already probed for the presence of the
EEPROM, one idea is something like:
I'm also assuming the new i2c.send takes the same mutiple data
parameters as i2c.write

-- read data from eeprom with 16-bit address sent high byte first.
function i2c.eeprom.read( id, slave, mem_addr, nbytes )
  -- i2c.send: assuming nil means failure and some integer means the
number of bytes written
  repeat until i2c.send( id, slave, false, msb( mem_addr ), lsb( mem_addr ) )
  -- i2c.recv: assuming nil means failure, otherwise a string of the
data received
  return i2c.recv( id, slave, true, nbytes )
end

function i2c.eeprom.write( id, slave, mem_addr, data )
  repeat
    result = i2c.send( id, slave, true, msb( mem_addr ), lsb( mem_addr ), data )
  until result
  -- How many of the data bytes were written?
  if result &lt; 2
    return nil
  else
    return result - 2
  fi
end

Again, the fact that these are in Lua reflects the fact that the
EEPROM data format is not part of I2C.  It's just one device that
happens to fill the I2C data with a 16-bit address in high-byte then
low-byte order, followed by the data to write to EEPROM.

My own problem with i2c.probe(id, address) is that AVR32 cannot send
empty data packets.
Do you happen to know what an I2C EEPROM does if you send it a single
0 byte (just the MSB of the memory address).
Ignores it, I hope; the spec doesn't say.
