Are you having to link in ncurses in order to get it to work?  I
believe that for most modern unix platforms just linking against
readline should work if a recent version is installed. On my Ubuntu
box I installed libreadline5-dev I believe and linked against that for
a readline library.

I also just checked in a version that uses linenoise instead to
eliminate those dependencies. This should work fine for Linux &amp; OS X.
There's not a full port of that library for Windows yet.

All that said, I'm not sure if this would have any effect on the issue
being encountered, but perhaps something strange is going on here.  I
believe I have had occasions at least on Windows where the timeouts
don't seem to work correctly unless I have something within luarpc.c
or one of the lower level layers print something like a debug
statement.

&gt;<i>

I don't believe so, but maybe something in the above might be relevant.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Awaiting your response.

On the windows side, I did find an issue that was preventing it from
reading data, at least on my machine.  I'm not sure why I've only
experienced this with LM3S, perhaps it has to do with which FTDI chip
is onboard?  In any case by not setting the DTR control to disabled,
and just leaving it in its default state (whatever that might be) it
now works for me on Windows XP 32-bit:

C:\elua&gt;luarpc test\test-rpc.lua
Platform: LM3S
CPU: LM3S6965
Board: EK-LM3S6965
CPU Clock: 50 MHz
Memory Used: 10.009765625 kB

I finally narrowed it down by a simple test program in C that just
sent the 9 byte opening sequence and then tried to read the 8 byte
header back.  Since I found this worked, I then started removing
things that weren't in this test setup from serial_win32 until I found
that applying this one setting ( dcb.fDtrControl =
DTR_CONTROL_DISABLE; ) would even prevent the test program from
successfully running until I had unplugged/replugged the USB
interface.  I'm guessing that for some reason, even though the DTR
line wouldn't even be used in this case, changing its state is messing
something up or maybe it's having the opposite effect of disabling
DTR?  Some more investigation is warranted.

This leads me to another question for others on the list: has anyone
been using either luarpc, mux or rfs with LM3S boards successfully
prior to this fix?  Bogdan, have you tried RFS or mux with an LM3S
eval kit using the onboard FTDI JTAG/UART for a serial interface?

</I>
It may be that it's just not printing the same information to the logs
with the version of Ubuntu you're running.    I can't imagine it's not
running that driver since I think that provides the virtual UART
functionality.
