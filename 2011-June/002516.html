<PRE>&gt;<i> On LM3S it should be:
</I>&gt;<i> platform_i2c_start_and_send_address(0, address)
</I>&gt;<i> platform_i2c_send_byte( 0, false, &amp;data,     20);
</I>&gt;<i> platform_i2c_recv_byte( 0, true,  &amp;data_rcv, 50); //true means stop.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You mean that i2c send can't be called 2 consecutive times on avr32?
</I>
&gt;<i>&quot;LMS3&quot; is a chip, not a software library, and chips don't have function
</I>calls.
&gt;<i>Maybe you're talking about the LMS3 SDK library functions? I don't know
</I>those.

Yeah sure, I mean these functions call could match perfectly the underlying
LM3S hardware and STR9.

&gt;<i>1) Redefine the eLua I2C APIs to express full I2C transfers as an
</I>&gt;<i>arbitrary sequence of sends and receives.
</I>
I follow you, it is too complex also from my point of view

&gt;<i>2) Leave the interface as it is and implement I2C on AVR32 as a
</I>&gt;<i>bit-banging interface, completely forgetting their TWI hardware.
</I>
Not efficient as you said.

&gt;<i>3) Redefine the eLua I2C APIs to give the 3 common cases of send,
</I>&gt;<i>receive and send-then-receive-with-repeated-start
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>That would be something like
</I>&gt;<i>platform_i2c_master_exists(unsigned id)
</I>&gt;<i>actual_speed = platform_i2c_master_setup(unsigned id, u32 speed)
</I>&gt;<i>success = platform_i2c_master_send(unsigned id, u8 slave_address, char
</I>&gt;<i>*send_buf, u32 nbytes_to_send)
</I>&gt;<i>success = platform_i2c_master_recv(unsigned id, u8 slave_address, char
</I>&gt;<i>*recv_buf, u32 nbytes_to_receive)
</I>&gt;<i>success = platform_i2c_master_send_recv(unsigned id, u8 slave_address,
</I>&gt;<i>char *send_buf, u32 nbytes_to_send, char *recv_buf, u32
</I>&gt;<i>nbytes_to_receive)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Where &quot;success&quot; indicates that the slave acknowledged its address and
</I>&gt;<i>all the sent bytes were acknowledged.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;probe&quot; becomes &quot;send(slave, NULL, 0)&quot;
</I>
I prefer this approach but your restrain too much to your CPU way of doing.
I mean if you use the function as I proposed (and that is almost identical
to initial I2C elua implementation)
means:
-one function to specify address
-one to send and specify stop
-one to receive and specify stop

I can implement on LM3S and STR9 full I2C protocol and thus very
efficiently.
And you can also implement a slightly limited I2C protocol too.

Stop must be always =true in your case.

The one I proposed is more open for LM3S and STR9, and stay simple, so you
can implement
it easily with limitation for AVR32 where stop is always TRUE.

In your case it could be:
Static static_address;

platform_i2c_start_and_send_address(0, address, direction)
{
	Static_address = address
}

platform_i2c_send_byte( id, do_stop, *data, len);
{
	If(!do_stop)
		return NOT_SUPPORTED;
	Avr32_i2c_master_send(id, static_address, data, len);
}

Etc...

Do you see where I want to go?

_On the other side_, your interface is OK AND simple.
Just it is a bit limitative I think (especially for hardware supporting
complex I2C transfer).
For my elua needs, still it seems OK...

So I let eLua guys choose.
I'm open to the two options.

&gt;<i>platform_i2c_master_exists(unsigned id)
</I>&gt;<i>actual_speed = platform_i2c_master_setup(unsigned id, u32 speed)
</I>
OK

&gt;<i>I suggest calling them platform_i2c_master_*  to leave the door open
</I>&gt;<i>to adding slave functionality in future without having to redefine the
</I>&gt;<i>existing master functions.  Note that some devices have single I2C
</I>&gt;<i>interfaces that can be switched between master and slave modes, while
</I>&gt;<i>others have separate master and slave hardware interfaces.
</I>
I like this.
