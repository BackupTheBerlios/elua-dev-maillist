</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Noted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> website for about a year watching it grow, at the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> same time I have developed a small Arduino shaped platform based on a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> LM39D92 from TI/Luminary. ( <A HREF="http://www.solderCore.com">http://www.solderCore.com</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.solderCore.com">http://www.solderCore.com</A> ). Website is completely out of date, so not all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the statement are still relevant.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The board has been designed to support a BASIC interpreter from Rowley
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Associates which has some similar characteristics to eLUA. I would also
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to this board to support eLUA, preferably when we launch July/August.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I was going to try and port over eLUA myself, as I kind of enjoy that type

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> essentially a hardware guy. I don't think the port would be that difficult
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as the LM3S9D92
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is this chip in pre-production with private specs or something similar? I
</I>&gt;<i> couldn't find anything related to 9D92 on ti.com or luminarymicro.com, thus
</I>&gt;<i> it's a bit hard to estimate the porting effort :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It might well be.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is very similar to the LM3S9B92, it has twice as much Flash,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and I believe the peripheral set is pretty much identical.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then the port should be extremely straightforward.
</I>
Yep. My guess is that you may have to update the driver lib to include
support for this part (assuming that it's in the current driver lib
even though the part isn't mentioned on the site), and then updating
memory configuration and pin configurations.

We use the Luminary/TI peripheral library for pretty much everything
on that platform, so there should be a great deal that needs changing
otherwise.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have a board or two that I don't mind giving away to anybody who could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> port this code. If anyone is interested please let me know and I can send
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> over more information.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll hold off on this until I find out more about that chip :) Although I
</I>&gt;<i> don't really expect surprises, it's highly unlikely that the overall core
</I>&gt;<i> changed too much.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I will find out the official word from TI, and see if I can send you a data
</I>&gt;<i> sheet.
</I>
I'd be interested in hearing about what's new in this chip as well.

That looks like a neat little board you have there, although I'm
wondering if more of the I/O is available than what's immediately
obvious from the image?  It looks like there are some header pins on
there, but it looks like that's just a Cortex JTAG connector (as
mentioned in the specs alongside the image).
