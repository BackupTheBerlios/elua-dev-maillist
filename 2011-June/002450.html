</I>&gt;<i> Hi Laurent

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Am I missing any use case?
</I>&gt;<i> On the contrary, you have too many and inappropriate ones!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am currently looking at implementing I2C on avr32 platforms, so
</I>&gt;<i> maybe we can define a common platform interface for the i2c platform
</I>&gt;<i> interface.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The ideal would be the smallest set of primitives that
</I>&gt;<i> 1) allows us to generate all possible I2C protocols, reacting to (and
</I>&gt;<i> informing the caller about) all possible error conditions during
</I>&gt;<i> reception/transmission, such as lack of ACK when it is required, or
</I>&gt;<i> loss of bus arbitration.
</I>&gt;<i> 2) covers all hardware implementations, from the highest level
</I>&gt;<i> intelligent hardware that does everything for you automatically, down
</I>&gt;<i> to bit-banging interfaces where you toggle and read the signals
</I>&gt;<i> explicitly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> An example of the lowest level can be found at
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/I2C#Example_of_bit-banging_the_I2C_Master_protocol">https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/I2C#Example_of_bit-banging_the_I2C_Master_protocol</A>
</I>&gt;<i> whose user interface to this code fragment seems to consist of two
</I>&gt;<i> byte-oriented functions:
</I>&gt;<i>  bool nak = i2c_write_byte(bool send_start, bool send_stop, unsigned char
</I>&gt;<i> data)
</I>&gt;<i>  unsigned char data = i2c_read_byte(bool nack, bool send_stop).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I agree with you; however, many chip manufacturers take a different approach
on this. They implement a sort of hardware I2C state machine which makes
things quite weird (at least for me) and hard to use. For example, on
STR9/STM32 there are different flags one most look for in order to detect
events such as &quot;address byte sent OK and acknowledged&quot; and &quot;data sent OK and
acknowledged&quot;, even though they are conceptually identical from the
transmitter side. I have no idea why they've chosen to make such a simple
interface so cumbersome to use (except maybe for some strange multi-master
configurations that are seldom used in practice), but we don't have many
choices here.


&gt;<i> For the AVR32, to send data you program the 7-bit device address and
</I>&gt;<i> the direction bit into one control register, then write you write the
</I>&gt;<i> first byte of data to be transmitted into another and this second
</I>&gt;<i> write triggers the hardware to do the whole sequence: start, address
</I>&gt;<i> and the first data byte all in one go. You then have to poke more data
</I>&gt;<i> into the second register while the first set of data is being
</I>&gt;<i> transmitted if you want to transmit multiple bytes in one message:
</I>&gt;<i> failure to do so automatically ends the current packet with a STOP.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
LOL. And I though STR9 was weird :) This is a very bad restriction, as I2C
itself doesn't have this kind of timing constraint (send bytes in sequence
without pauses).


&gt;<i> Unfortunately, the current elua module interface is too low level for
</I>&gt;<i> either of these implementations in that it has i2c.start(),
</I>&gt;<i> i2c.address() and i2c.write() as separate functions.  For both of
</I>&gt;<i> these above interfaces, the bit-banging and the AVR32, this forces the
</I>&gt;<i> driver to collect up information from a predefined sequence of start()
</I>&gt;<i> address() read() write() calls, storing them in private, persistent
</I>&gt;<i> data, and then use these data when the final call happens (read or
</I>&gt;<i> write) that gives sense to the single I2C operation.
</I>&gt;<i>  It also creates the question of whether the driver should detect
</I>&gt;<i> improper sequences of these Lua primitives, or how it should react to
</I>&gt;<i> them, for example, you call read() without a preceding address() or
</I>&gt;<i> address() without a preceding start().
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I'd let the user worry about that for the moment, but you're right, it might
be something worth implementing.


&gt;<i> It also fails to allow you to detect loss of bus arbitration when
</I>&gt;<i> there are multiple masters on the same bus.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This is on purpose :) I thought there wasn't much point in making the
interface more complex for a situation so rare in practice (the multiple
master configuration).


&gt;<i> The interface in wikipedia seems to be about the lowest possible
</I>&gt;<i> sensible level: (read/write byte with optional start, stop, ack/nak
</I>&gt;<i> bits), though it doesn't really handle loss of bus arbitration, and
</I>&gt;<i> there is no distinction between addresses and data.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By comparison, the AVR32 hardware performs combined write/read
</I>&gt;<i> sequences with a second start bit in a single operation, such as are
</I>&gt;<i> used to access EEPROMs. Trying to map a sequence of
</I>&gt;<i> i2c.start/address/write/read calls into this single operation would
</I>&gt;<i> require a semi-intelligent state machine to parse the sequence of
</I>&gt;<i> calls.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The low-level interface is as generic as it gets (as usual). The higher
level interfaces I read here (LM3S included) seem to address specifically
the common use scenarios over I2C interfaces:

1. write: send start, send I2C address+w, send device register address, send
bytes to write, send stop
2. read: send start, send I2C address+w, send device register address, send
start, send I2C address+r, read and ACK everything except the last byte,
send stop

It limits the functionality a bit (for example the master could in theory
send a START at any time to a slave in order to reset it if anything goes
wrong with the comunication) but since this is what we have in most hardware
it seems the right thing to implement.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So how about changing the eLua Lua primitives for i2c to something a
</I>&gt;<i> bit higher level, that reflects the range of possible I2C protocol
</I>&gt;<i> sequences. There are only about three major variants as far as I can
</I>&gt;<i> see: master write, master read and combined write-read sequences, plus
</I>&gt;<i> a probe no-op to see if there is a slave present on a given address.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Right, thanks, I forgot about the last one. It is also used to detect end of
operation while writing data to an I2C EEPROM (while the memory writes the
data it won't acknowledge its slave addres). So we agree, there are 3 basic
operations that should be taken into consideration: read, write and query.
And yes, in the light of the information from you and Laurent I agree that
we must change our I2C platform interface. Do you agree with this format
(high level description):

1. init( id, speed )
2. write( id, i2caddr, devaddr, bytes ) (could be simply 'write( id,
i2caddr, bytes )' but I want to make it symetrical with number 3 below).
3. read( id, i2caddr, devaddr, numbytes ) (&quot;devaddr&quot; could have a special
value meaning &quot;don't send an address&quot; as some devices don't need an address
for a read operation (for example an I2C EEPROM which supports sequential
reads: specify an address just on the first 'read' command, after which the
device's internal address register increments automatically). I'm still not
sure if this optimization is just asking for trouble or it can actually be
implemented on all (or at least most) of our platforms).
4. query (id, i2caddr)


&gt;<i> Expressing a meaningful i2c transaction in a single Lua function call
</I>&gt;<i> would also means that, on loss of bus arbitration during a message,
</I>&gt;<i> the generic i2c code could just wait for the bus to become free again
</I>&gt;<i> and retry the message without making client Lua cose detect and handle
</I>&gt;<i> this condition.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Absolutely.


&gt;<i> It would also mean that the more intelligent devices that perform
</I>&gt;<i> whole I2C operations in hardware could be used.  With the present
</I>&gt;<i> i2c.*() Lua interface (and the resulting C platform interface),
</I>&gt;<i> implementing eLua I2C on such devices is needlessly complex, even
</I>&gt;<i> without contempleting its DMA capabilities direct to from EEPROM...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've been staring at this all day and have now had enough, but I
</I>&gt;<i> thought I'd write to let you know you're not alone, and to raise the
</I>&gt;<i> issue of changing the Lua module interface, since this impacts on the
</I>&gt;<i> C platform interface.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My own difficulty with changing the i2c interfaces is that I wouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> want to reimplement the existing str9 code and I don't have str9 (or
</I>&gt;<i> lm3s) hardware to test such hings on
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Don't worry about that, I'll be happy to implement them myself once we agree
on an interface. I'm actually glad this happens now, when the only
(official) implementation of I2C is on STR9 :)

Best,
Bogdan
