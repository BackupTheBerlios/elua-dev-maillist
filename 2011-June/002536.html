Thanks.  Yes, you would need to do the reading of the blocks at Lua
level as separate I2C transactions as you describe.

&gt;<i> I just feel that the I2C

</I>
The advantage of making the eLua APIs match the I2C protocol
definition is that you can be sure to implement the API on any
hardware, can be sure to drive any device, and be sure that users can
only talk valid I2C language, however they call it.
It's also a way of teaching learners exactly what valid I2C protocol means.

I'm working on the assumption that modelling the eLua APIs on the I2C
specification is the best way to guarantee that we will be able to
drive all master interfaces and talk to all slave devices, including
those we do not know, or that have not been produced yet.

On one hand, the spec does say that I2C does not impose a limit on the
amount of data present in one transfer.
On the other, ir doesn't say that it's mandatory for a master to be
able to handle infinite length transfers.

&gt;<i> Absolutely. I'm not using EEPROM as an example because I want to model our
</I>&gt;<i> I2C platform interface after it, it's just an use case I'm quite familiar
</I>&gt;<i> with in practice and I can use it to detect limitations in our interface. So
</I>&gt;<i> far it's doing a pretty good job :)
</I>
I confess that starting a 32-megabyte transfer in one function call,
then reading the data of one packet in 256-bytes chunks with separate
function calls is not a usage scenario that I had thought of.

Here's another nightmare for you. I just found a device that eats
infinite-length data packets for lunch.
It's an 8-bit ADC/DAC device
<A HREF="http://www.nxp.com/documents/data_sheet/PCF8591.pdf">http://www.nxp.com/documents/data_sheet/PCF8591.pdf</A>
that can perform both analog-to-digital or digital-to-analog
conversion in the same time it takes to transmit or receive one byte
and it can send you an infinite amount of data, or you can send *it*
an infinite amount of data in one I2C read or write packet, assuming
that you can consume or generate it fast enough: one sample every
90us, i.e. every nine 100kHz bus clocks == 11,111 samples per second.
To do audio, you'd have to be able to make a Lua-to-C-to-Lua
transition in 90 us so as not have glitches in the output or miss
samples on input. At 100 MHz CPU clock and 4 cycles per instruction,
that's something like 250 instructions, which sounds possible in
assembler. Could you make a round trip from the Lua interpreter to C
and back in that sort of time and do something useful with the data?
Would you want to? :)

&gt;&gt;<i> My own problem with i2c.probe(id, address) is that AVR32 cannot send
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> empty data packets.
</I>
&gt;<i> This is getting ridiculous. At this point I wish they kept the I2C engine
</I>&gt;<i> from their 8 bit AVR MCU line. Besides not being able to to DMA transfers
</I>&gt;<i> (although I'm not sure if this is still true for XMEGAs) it was much better
</I>&gt;<i> than what they offer in the AVR32 IMO.
</I>
It gets worse. A different ADC instead
<A HREF="http://www.ti.com/lit/gpn/ads7823">http://www.ti.com/lit/gpn/ads7823</A>
when you just send it a single zero data byte, that means &quot;power up
and convert 4 samples from analog to digital&quot;.  I suppose, as it's a
slave device, that one case is harmess, but what might other devices
do?  Anyway, there's nothing I can do about that.

The only difference the AVR32 limitation makes to us is that it
suggests adding i2c_master_probe( id, slave_address ) to the C
platform interface, so that AVR32 can do it's brain-damaged thing
sending a 0 byte, while allowing other platform can do something more
healthy.  If that were implemented at a higher level as send(id,
address, NULL, 0, true), the AVR32 would have to either fail that
always because it can't do it (making probe() unusable) or send a
single zero data byte when the user asked for none. I'm not sure which
is worse.

I guess that's why they call it TWI, not I2C.  Unfortunately, I have
this to work with :(

Is it too much to limit the data transfer size to the RAM you want to
dedicate to one message?
Implementing a multi-function stop-and-go interface frightens me.
