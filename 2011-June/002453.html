Many thanks for these suggestions. Whether they are mature or not
doesn't necessarily mean they are well-designed. They may just be old
;-).
In fact, they are all totally different:

&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://mbed.org/handbook/I2C">http://mbed.org/handbook/I2C</A>
</I>
frequency() read() write() start() stop().   The same as eLua's current.

&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/Wire">http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/Wire</A>
</I>
bizarre.

&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://labdasar.ee.itb.ac.id/lab/installer/embedded/ecos-3.0.cygwin/ecos-3.0/doc/html/ref/i2c-api.html">http://labdasar.ee.itb.ac.id/lab/installer/embedded/ecos-3.0.cygwin/ecos-3.0/doc/html/ref/i2c-api.html</A>
</I>
Two functions:
uint32 cyg_i2c_tx(const cyg_i2c_device* device, const cyg_uint8*
tx_data, cyg_uint32 count)
uint32 cyg_i2c_rx(const cyg_i2c_device* device, cyg_uint8* rx_data,
cyg_uint32 count);
where cyg_i2c_device encodes &quot;which i2c bus&quot;, &quot;slave address&quot; and &quot;speed&quot;
looks like the closest yet... until you try to do a write-read
combined message. Then you have to use a different, big hairy
transaction-oriented interface, because the &quot;simple&quot; interface above
doesn't allow tx-rx without an intervening stop.

&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://code.bsd64.org/browse/freebsd/RELENG_8_0/src/sys/dev/iicbus/iic.h">http://code.bsd64.org/browse/freebsd/RELENG_8_0/src/sys/dev/iicbus/iic.h</A>
</I>
start, stop, read, write, rdwr(?), and repeated-start.  Again, too
low-level for high level hardware

&gt;<i> eLua's platform C API can also be a bit lower level than the Lua API
</I>&gt;<i> as well in case some commands might need to be bundled together for
</I>&gt;<i> efficiency/timing purposes.
</I>
No, I need to keep the whole I2C message, including a combined
write-read sequence, intact down to the platform level, otherwise the
hardware generates a STOP automatically if the read request doesn't
arrive in time.
If your basic primitives are start() stop() readbyte() writebyte(),
the higher level description can easily be implemented in terms of
them.  But if the platform interface is at a lower level than this, it
is quite difficlt to reconstruct the original combined message by
spotting a special sequence of starts, tx and rx messages.  You would
still end up having to buffer everything from the start to the first
stop and then performing the whole operation at that time.

&gt;<i> Perhaps we could aim for keeping things
</I>&gt;<i> fairly generic, simple and atomic at the platform C API level
</I>
Of these words I think understand &quot;atomic&quot;: it means &quot;a single
operation that either completes in its entirety or doesn't happen at
all&quot;, which suggests keeping entire I2C messages as single objects all
the way down.

 and then
&gt;<i> perhaps provide some convenience or group some operations within the
</I>&gt;<i> higher level Lua API?
</I>

&gt;<i> Some of them include
</I>&gt;<i> semantics (like arduino) to use send to queue messages and then send
</I>&gt;<i> them when the transmission is ended, then ACK/NACK status is returned.
</I>
Exactly what I was hoping to avoid, since you have to copy and buffer
a potentially infinite amount of data, then send it when they say
&quot;stop&quot;, which means you have to be able to allocate arbitrary amounts
of memory inside the device driver.

&gt;<i> FWIW: I'm not too concerned about running in slave mode either at this point.
</I>
Nor am I personally, but if we are designing a world-class API that
will be with eLua forever, maybe thinking about it would be a good
idea at this point.  I gather that the buttons on the Mizar32 LCD
display are supposed to work in master mode with the AVR32 SoC as
slave so that you don't have to do busy-wait polling to detect button
presses (you prod the button-controlling PIC, go into slave mode and
then wait for the buttons to poke you).  However, this may just be a
case of poor design, and the LCD/button hardware module is not one of
those scheduled to be ready for the initial product release, so we can
still review its design.
