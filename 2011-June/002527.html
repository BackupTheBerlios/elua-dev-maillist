If the generic interface can express I2C well, it will be appropriate
for all I2C hardware.
Specific pieces of hardware are cases that test whether the API is
appropriate, but are not what define it.
For example, if you look at the broken AVR32 hardware, you might
conclude (like I did) that the only valid case of repeated start is
when you send 1, 2 or 3 bytes and receive N.  Fortunately, Laurent
stopped me from doing that! (Thanks, L!)

&gt;&gt;<i> platform_i2c_master_send( id, address, &amp;data, 20, false );
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> platform_i2c_master_recv( id, address, &amp;data_rcv, 50, true ); //true means stop.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I love the simplicity of this and if it proves to be enough I'll not

</I>&gt;<i> Still thinking what to do with the lower level ops (send start, send stop and so on)
</I>
They can be used to implement the valid I2C operations. For example:

  platform_i2c_master_send( id, address, data, nbytes, true );
is
  platform_i2c_send_start( id );
  platform_i2c_send_address( id, address, PLATFORM_I2C_DIRECTION_TRANSMITTER  );
  for (i=0; i&lt;nbytes; i++) platform_i2c_send_byte( id, data[i] );
  platform_i2c_send_stop( id );

In fact, if we add checking for success and &quot;if (stop)
platform_i2c_send_stop( id )&quot;, that is the implementation of the new
interface on the existing platforms.  We don't even need to remove the
existing platform functions, just make them static when the old
interface is removed.

&gt;<i> As I see it at the moment, since they're probably rarely needed in
</I>&gt;<i> practice a good place for them would be in a platform specific module
</I>&gt;<i> (stm32.i2c or str9.i2c for example)
</I>
If we get the platform interface right, that can express all valid I2C
operations and no invalid ones, they won't be necessary.
A good API would not allow people to say START START STOP ADDRESS STOP

The questions are:
1)  is it sufficient to express everything that is valid I2C?
2) does it allow people to express things that are not valid I2C?

As far as i can see, it allows any valid I2C sequence to be sent,
including arbitrary sequences of writes and reads with repeated
starts, maybe to different slave devices, which is valid I2C and is
used to initialize a series of data acquisition devices and have them
all start capturing data in sync when the final STOP is sent.

The only invalid I2C that I can see it allowing is if they forget to
set STOP on the very last message before the program exits.
