</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I know you're probably sick and tired of my EEPROM examples :) but I'm going
to get back to that again. In one of my applications I actually read the
whole content of a serial EEPROM (32KB (not Kb)) into a file in the
filesystem. Reading the whole data and writing it in one step is simply not
good enough because I'd need too much memory for the operation, so instead
I'm reading it in chunks of 256 bytes. For this kind of application, an &quot;I2C
data packet&quot; is an undefined concept, as the packet can be as large as the
memory itself, as small as 1 byte of data or an arbitrary size (256 bytes of
data). I specify the memory address (0) only at the beginning, then I keep
on reading data until I have enough, at which point I send a &quot;stop&quot;. Yes, I
can also do this by issuing repeated &quot;read&quot; commands with increasing
addresses, but that adds an overhead. And I'm not worried about the actual
impact of the overhead (which is very small), I just feel that the I2C
interface introduces limitations that shouldn't be there ...


&gt;<i> Keep that thought in mind a moment...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, AVR32 cannot write data without an address; the hardware can
</I>&gt;<i> only handles complete I2C packets, so that's that.
</I>&gt;<i> If you go back to function calls that write half an I2C packet, the
</I>&gt;<i> AVR32 is going to have to collect them up until it gets a stop and
</I>&gt;<i> then send them all.  That means being able to allocate arbitrary
</I>&gt;<i> amounts of RAM in the C device driver, which I don't think is
</I>&gt;<i> desirable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Furthermore, if you make the C platform interface deal only in whole
</I>&gt;<i> I2C packets, you can be sure to be able to implement I2C on other
</I>&gt;<i> future hardware platforms that also only deal in complete I2C packets.
</I>&gt;<i> AVR32 is just the first example we have found that needs this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If we do chunked reads (read_from_address followed by read) we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can't know in advance when the last one will be sent. I'm guessing that
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; read functions need another parameter (ack_last_byte).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yuck!  Why would you want to read half a response?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Hopefully my example above answers your questions.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; After an EEPROM receives the data to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; write it needs some time to write it, during this time it will not be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; accesible and it will not ACK its device address.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm.  Well, once you define the eeprom-reading and eeprom-writing
</I>&gt;<i> functions in Lua on top of the I2C module, you can move the check
</I>&gt;<i> there.  Assuming you have already probed for the presence of the
</I>&gt;<i> EEPROM, one idea is something like:
</I>&gt;<i> I'm also assuming the new i2c.send takes the same mutiple data
</I>&gt;<i> parameters as i2c.write
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -- read data from eeprom with 16-bit address sent high byte first.
</I>&gt;<i> function i2c.eeprom.read( id, slave, mem_addr, nbytes )
</I>&gt;<i>  -- i2c.send: assuming nil means failure and some integer means the
</I>&gt;<i> number of bytes written
</I>&gt;<i>  repeat until i2c.send( id, slave, false, msb( mem_addr ), lsb( mem_addr )
</I>&gt;<i> )
</I>&gt;<i>  -- i2c.recv: assuming nil means failure, otherwise a string of the
</I>&gt;<i> data received
</I>&gt;<i>  return i2c.recv( id, slave, true, nbytes )
</I>&gt;<i> end
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> function i2c.eeprom.write( id, slave, mem_addr, data )
</I>&gt;<i>  repeat
</I>&gt;<i>    result = i2c.send( id, slave, true, msb( mem_addr ), lsb( mem_addr ),
</I>&gt;<i> data )
</I>&gt;<i>  until result
</I>&gt;<i>  -- How many of the data bytes were written?
</I>&gt;<i>  if result &lt; 2
</I>&gt;<i>    return nil
</I>&gt;<i>  else
</I>&gt;<i>    return result - 2
</I>&gt;<i>  fi
</I>&gt;<i> end
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, the fact that these are in Lua reflects the fact that the
</I>&gt;<i> EEPROM data format is not part of I2C.  It's just one device that
</I>&gt;<i> happens to fill the I2C data with a 16-bit address in high-byte then
</I>&gt;<i> low-byte order, followed by the data to write to EEPROM.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Absolutely. I'm not using EEPROM as an example because I want to model our
I2C platform interface after it, it's just an use case I'm quite familiar
with in practice and I can use it to detect limitations in our interface. So
far it's doing a pretty good job :)

My own problem with i2c.probe(id, address) is that AVR32 cannot send
&gt;<i> empty data packets.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This is getting ridiculous. At this point I wish they kept the I2C engine
from their 8 bit AVR MCU line. Besides not being able to to DMA transfers
(although I'm not sure if this is still true for XMEGAs) it was much better
than what they offer in the AVR32 IMO.


&gt;<i> Do you happen to know what an I2C EEPROM does if you send it a single
</I>&gt;<i> 0 byte (just the MSB of the memory address).
</I>&gt;<i> Ignores it, I hope; the spec doesn't say.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Hmmm, hard to say. It wouldn't be a problem for EEPROMs I think, but I don't
know what's the case for other I2C devices.

Best,
Bogdan
