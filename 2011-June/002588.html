<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> Hi

</I>&gt;<i> This has been a lobotomy to the project, made worse by the failure to

</I>&gt;<i> In the intervening month between the mysterious &quot;Is there anybody here

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I agree 100% with you. Yes, we should have make this public. The reason we
didn't, however, isn't linked to our public image. Dado and his team have
been working VERY hard to restore the tracker data (quite a costly operation
too) and we kept on hoping that it will get back quickly. This has been
going on for a while now and the hope is still not gone, but I (for one)
simply didn't register the fact that quite a lot of time passed since the
tracker failed and we should inform the community about it. And for that I
apologize to you and everyone else. You're right, we shold have been more
careful with this.


&gt;<i> This is a good moment to drop tracker.eluaproject.net and create a bug
</I>&gt;<i> tracker and wiki on elua.googlecode.com
</I>

We're considering alternatives, yes. Thanks for the suggestion. The main
problem here is that the whole team really likes Redmine, it's very flexible
and powerful. FYI, the tracker didn't go down because of bugs in Redmine,
there were other issues involved. So if we'll be able to find good Redmine
hosting in a reasonable time frame we'll go that way.


&gt;<i> They keep three full copies of all data in different datacenters, any
</I>&gt;<i> individual can download and save the wiki contents using Mercurial
</I>&gt;<i> $ hg clone <A HREF="https://wiki.mizar32.googlecode.com/hg">https://wiki.mizar32.googlecode.com/hg</A> hg-wiki
</I>&gt;<i> and it seems you can even backup the issue tracker contents using this API
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.softpedia.com/get/Programming/SDK-DDK/Google-Code-Issue-Tracker-API.shtml">http://www.softpedia.com/get/Programming/SDK-DDK/Google-Code-Issue-Tracker-API.shtml</A>
</I>&gt;<i> so even if Google goes bankrupt, simplemachines doesn't have to.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Thanks again, we'll keep that in mind.

Best,
Bogdan
