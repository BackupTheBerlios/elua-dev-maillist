<PRE>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What's odd here is that I did hook up a scope to both Rx and Tx lines
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and at least at the MCU it appears to be sending back the initial
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> handshake reply.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sure, I too was able to confirm this with stub code.
</I>
Hello,

You've been able to receive data from the MCU during this exchange
using some alternate code? 

I was able to confirm that the rx and tx on the micro-controller 
are working fine.

What's especially weird for me is that at
least with what's opened and set up using the serial layer in LuaRPC
it never seems to get _anything_ even if I double-send the header
back.  I would presume that the serial layer were broken in general on
Windows, since I can use TeraTerm to use the eLua shell, but STM32
works fine.

When I wrote a few extra lines of code to retransmit the header
received, the micro-controller only transmitted a string of '#'. At 
this point, I suspected the PC side transmit module. (./luarpc
instance). Here I was certain that the bug was not relevant in 
the Elua domain. Would you agree with my conclusion ?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What I can't figure out is why it never appears in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the buffer in Windows.  There's plenty of buffer space allocated
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> beforehand.  One difference I notice in timing between POSIX and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Windows is that it seems to send the connection request byte and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> header as one &quot;packet&quot; whereas with windows there is a couple
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> millisecond delay between the sending of the connection request byte
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and the 8 header bytes.  Additionally, there appears to be a longer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> delay in responding to the single 9 byte POSIX send vs the separated
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Windows 1 + 2ms + 8 byte send.  I haven't looked at timing on an STM32
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> platform yet to see how it differs if at all but I wonder if this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> might be related to timing?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Certainly, there is a very good possibility of the problem emanating from
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> delta delay. I have also obtained &quot;MY ERROR: header exchange failed&quot; in
</I>&gt;<i> addition to the &quot;no data received when attempting to read&quot; error.
</I>... [show rest of quote]

The header exchange error is interesting, that indicates that it is
reading something back.  Have you experienced that only on one
particular platform or another?

Yes, it brings up an interesting point. I have experienced this only
on Windows. On Gnu/Linux, it just takes me to a waiting state. 
One direct possibility for this might be the lack of FNDELAY in
fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, 0); I am yet to confirm this in the source level.
(serial/serial_posix.c). Is this the case ?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have also tried building on Gnu/Linux. The response is identical. The
</I>&gt;<i> ./luarpc
</I>&gt;<i> instance, while executing rpc.connect(&quot;/dev/ttyUSB0&quot;) takes me to an
</I>&gt;<i> infinite
</I>&gt;<i> waiting state. (Despite its posix compliance, which was tested
</I>&gt;<i> successfully
</I>&gt;<i> on mac ?)
</I>
Could you let me know which version of Linux you're using?  It does
work for me on Ubuntu x86_64 11.04.

When I tried this just about a week ago, I was using Ubuntu Remix 
(netbook edition), 10.04, Lucid Lynx, Intel X86

I will try running it on a 10.10 box. Will keep you posted.

This is awesome. Can't wait for lrpc to work on my box.

Also here's some stuff that was dumped into the system logs when the
kernel was initializing the device:
[10211.120029] usb 8-1: new full speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address

It'd be interesting if you've got a different version or perhaps got a
different packet size configuration?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Have you encountered this before ?
</I>
Not on Linux, but I have also done most of my testing and evaluation
on OS X.  I'd like to be able to reproduce this one on Linux as well
since that would help narrow things down.

I did try lengthening the delay on the server side for sending a reply
back, but that doesn't seem to make any difference.  

I did play around with timeout. It didn't make a difference. 

It also doesn't seem to get anything if I try sending additional copies of
the header
or arbitrary data, the read in Windows just comes back empty
regardless.  This makes me wonder if something is broken in the state
with the windows driver at the time the data is sent, or perhaps one
of them isn't playing precisely by the rules in terms of
physical/RS-232 state?

Sure, but on those occasions when I obtained &quot;Header exchange mismatch&quot;,
I least suspected the driver. How do we proceed towards cornering the fault
?

Regarding your Linux setup, is the version of Linux you're running
native or in a VM under windows? Is the 32 or 64 bit and which
OS/kernel version might you be running?  I wonder if you're having the
same issue under both or if there are different issues going on here?

It was native, 32 bit, Kernel version: 2.6.2X.

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It has definitely worked in the past on this platform.  I may start
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> trying to find the last working version and then use git bisect to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> find what change caused the current problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Awaiting your response.
</I>
One other quick note: replying to digests might make this thread a bit
difficult to follow in the future.  If you're wanting to continue
using digests for replies, might I suggest trying something like
Nabble:
<A HREF="http://elua-development.2368040.n2.nabble.com/">http://elua-development.2368040.n2.nabble.com/</A>

It makes this list appear like a forum and even will allow you to
subscribe to individual conversations. 

Sure, will incorporate this protocol. Thanks.

Awaiting your reply.
