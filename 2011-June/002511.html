<PRE>Hello,

I have been watching eLUA website for about a year watching it grow, at the
same time I have developed a small Arduino shaped platform based on a
LM39D92 from TI/Luminary. ( <A HREF="http://www.solderCore.com">http://www.solderCore.com</A>
<A HREF="http://www.solderCore.com">http://www.solderCore.com</A> ). Website is completely out of date, so not all
the statement are still relevant.
The board has been designed to support a BASIC interpreter from Rowley
Associates which has some similar characteristics to eLUA. I would also like
to this board to support eLUA, preferably when we launch July/August.

I was going to try and port over eLUA myself, as I kind of enjoy that type
of stuff, however, it would take me while as no matter how hard I try, I'm
essentially a hardware guy. I don't think the port would be that difficult
as the LM3S9D92 is very similar to the LM3S9B92, it has twice as much Flash,
and I believe the peripheral set is pretty much identical.

I have a board or two that I don't mind giving away to anybody who could
port this code. If anyone is interested please let me know and I can send
over more information.

Thanks

Iain
