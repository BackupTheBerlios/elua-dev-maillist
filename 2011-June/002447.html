Hi Laurent

&gt;<i> Am I missing any use case?
</I>On the contrary, you have too many and inappropriate ones!

I am currently looking at implementing I2C on avr32 platforms, so
maybe we can define a common platform interface for the i2c platform
interface.

The ideal would be the smallest set of primitives that
1) allows us to generate all possible I2C protocols, reacting to (and
informing the caller about) all possible error conditions during
reception/transmission, such as lack of ACK when it is required, or
loss of bus arbitration.
2) covers all hardware implementations, from the highest level
intelligent hardware that does everything for you automatically, down
to bit-banging interfaces where you toggle and read the signals
explicitly.

An example of the lowest level can be found at
<A HREF="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/I2C#Example_of_bit-banging_the_I2C_Master_protocol">https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/I2C#Example_of_bit-banging_the_I2C_Master_protocol</A>
whose user interface to this code fragment seems to consist of two
byte-oriented functions:
  bool nak = i2c_write_byte(bool send_start, bool send_stop, unsigned char data)
  unsigned char data = i2c_read_byte(bool nack, bool send_stop).

For the AVR32, to send data you program the 7-bit device address and
the direction bit into one control register, then write you write the
first byte of data to be transmitted into another and this second
write triggers the hardware to do the whole sequence: start, address
and the first data byte all in one go. You then have to poke more data
into the second register while the first set of data is being
transmitted if you want to transmit multiple bytes in one message:
failure to do so automatically ends the current packet with a STOP.

Unfortunately, the current elua module interface is too low level for
either of these implementations in that it has i2c.start(),
i2c.address() and i2c.write() as separate functions.  For both of
these above interfaces, the bit-banging and the AVR32, this forces the
driver to collect up information from a predefined sequence of start()
address() read() write() calls, storing them in private, persistent
data, and then use these data when the final call happens (read or
write) that gives sense to the single I2C operation.
  It also creates the question of whether the driver should detect
improper sequences of these Lua primitives, or how it should react to
them, for example, you call read() without a preceding address() or
address() without a preceding start().
It also fails to allow you to detect loss of bus arbitration when
there are multiple masters on the same bus.

The interface in wikipedia seems to be about the lowest possible
sensible level: (read/write byte with optional start, stop, ack/nak
bits), though it doesn't really handle loss of bus arbitration, and
there is no distinction between addresses and data.

By comparison, the AVR32 hardware performs combined write/read
sequences with a second start bit in a single operation, such as are
used to access EEPROMs. Trying to map a sequence of
i2c.start/address/write/read calls into this single operation would
require a semi-intelligent state machine to parse the sequence of
calls.

So how about changing the eLua Lua primitives for i2c to something a
bit higher level, that reflects the range of possible I2C protocol
sequences. There are only about three major variants as far as I can
see: master write, master read and combined write-read sequences, plus
a probe no-op to see if there is a slave present on a given address.
Expressing a meaningful i2c transaction in a single Lua function call
would also means that, on loss of bus arbitration during a message,
the generic i2c code could just wait for the bus to become free again
and retry the message without making client Lua cose detect and handle
this condition.
It would also mean that the more intelligent devices that perform
whole I2C operations in hardware could be used.  With the present
i2c.*() Lua interface (and the resulting C platform interface),
implementing eLua I2C on such devices is needlessly complex, even
without contempleting its DMA capabilities direct to from EEPROM...

I've been staring at this all day and have now had enough, but I
thought I'd write to let you know you're not alone, and to raise the
issue of changing the Lua module interface, since this impacts on the
C platform interface.

My own difficulty with changing the i2c interfaces is that I wouldn't
want to reimplement the existing str9 code and I don't have str9 (or
lm3s) hardware to test such hings on

Thoughts?
