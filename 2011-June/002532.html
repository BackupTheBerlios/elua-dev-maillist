I completely agree with you, but my point was that at the lowest I2C level
(that we can afford :) ) we need to be able to do write without an address
too. Having to send the device address each time we write something is a
limitation in the interface.
It gets even more interesting with reads, where sometimes the protocol
requires that the master acknowledges every byte read from the slave EXCEPT
the last one. If we do chunked reads (read_from_address followed by read) we
can't know in advance when the last one will be sent. I'm guessing that the
read functions need another parameter (ack_last_byte).
While writing this, it occured to me that this simple interface might still
not be good enough for EEPROMs (I'm coming back to this use case all the
time because it's the one I know best). After an EEPROM receives the data to
write it needs some time to write it, during this time it will not be
accesible and it will not ACK its device address. This is how the master
knows when the EEPROM finished the write operation: it polls it by sending
start+its address on the I2C bus and checks for an ACK. This is called
acknowledge polling. From the 24LC256 manual:

Since the device will not acknowledge during a write
cycle, this can be used to determine when the cycle is
complete (This feature can be used to maximize bus
throughput). Once the Stop condition for a Write
command has been issued from the master, the device
initiates the internally timed write cycle. ACK polling
can be initiated immediately. This involves the master
sending a Start condition, followed by the control byte
for a Write command (R/W =  0). If the device is still
busy with the write cycle, then no ACK will be returned.
If no ACK is returned, the Start bit and control byte must
be resent. If the cycle is complete, then the device will
return the ACK and the master can then proceed with
the next Read or Write command.

Not sure how to implement this with our interface. Maybe with a
write_to_address with an empty (NULL) buffer, assuming that reads/writes
return an error if the slave device didn't ACK (which is a good idea
anyway). A bit ugly, but it should work.

Best,
Bogdan
