How do you do on AVR32 to send address then 20 data and receive 50 data?
On LM3S it should be:
platform_i2c_start_and_send_address(0, address)
platform_i2c_send_byte( 0, false, &amp;data,     20);
platform_i2c_recv_byte( 0, true,  &amp;data_rcv, 50); //true means stop.

You mean that i2c send can't be called 2 consecutive times on avr32?
Or do you mean you need something like...
I2C_transfer transfer_struct[3] = {
  {I2C_ADDR,     false, &amp;null,    0x12},
  {I2C_TRANSMIT, false, &amp;data,      20},
  {I2C_RECEIVE,  true,  &amp;data_rcev, 50}
};

Platform_i2c_transfer(&amp;transfer_struct, 3);

Do I misunderstand anything, or my example is too simple :)?

Good find. So yes, there are devices that require repeated starts.  Thanks.
They mention two devices that need a write-read sequence with repeated
start: the MLX90614 temperature sensor and the Lego Mindstorms
Ultrasonic sensor.  Someone suggests a third primitive to do
send-and-receive-with-repeated-start to cover the cases that we have
seen where repeated start is useful.

But read also the last paragraph of this comment in that thread
<A HREF="http://mbed.org/forum/mbed/topic/586/?page=1#comment-3735">http://mbed.org/forum/mbed/topic/586/?page=1#comment-3735</A>
which mentions a need to synchronize several data acquisition devices
by configuring them all with repeated starts to different slave
addresses, then the single stop is what triggers them all to start
their data acquisition in sync.

This is why implementing the I2C specification is how to get it right.
That way we can be sure to have covered the devices that we do not
know about, and there are more of those than the few we have on hand.

&gt;<i> How about the C api I proposed in previous mail?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> int platform_i2c_start_and_send_address( unsigned id, u16 address, int
</I>&gt;<i> direction )
</I>&gt;<i> int platform_i2c_send_byte( unsigned id, u8 do_stop, u8* data, u8 len)
</I>&gt;<i> int platform_i2c_recv_byte( unsigned id, u8 do_stop, u8* data, u8 len)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just adds a &quot;do_stop&quot; vars on top of what you proposed to manage the
</I>&gt;<i> repeated start case.
</I>&gt;<i> Should cover the restart cases.

AVR32 must have the whole transfer available as a single unit at the
lowest level; the above interface is too low level.
and cannot be implemented on AVR32 without send_byte having to make a
copy of an unknown number of bytes and then sending them all when it
is told &quot;that's all&quot;.  Anything more naive would create a race
condition.


Some further points:

- I suggested that the speed setup take a numeric parameter instead of
the current two symbols HIGH and LOW, since the bus speed does not
have two discrete values, but takes a speed up to those maximum
speeds.   I2C has variants that can run at 0-100kHz, 0-400kHz, 0-1MHz
and 0-3.4MHz, while SMBus runs at 10kHz-100kHz. These are all
expressible as the usual double precision float or as a long integer,
and returning the &quot;actual speed set&quot; is coherent with the
speed-setting primitives in the other modules.

- in the new Lua interface, if we also change the names &quot;read&quot; and
&quot;write&quot;, that removes all overlap between the old and new interfaces.
That way the two interfaces can coexist in the transition period,
while we write the new code, test it and then, when it seems OK,
remove the old one.
  The I2C language for what we are calling &quot;read&quot; and &quot;write&quot; are
&quot;master send&quot; and &quot;master receive&quot; (completed by &quot;slave send&quot; and
&quot;slave receive&quot;), so your &quot;send&quot; and &quot;recv&quot; names would both achieve
this and reflect standard I2C terminology.

However, Bogdan has the last word on API names. Meanwhile, let's try
to understand what functionality is required.
