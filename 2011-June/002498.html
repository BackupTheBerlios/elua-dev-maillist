<PRE>Hello,

 

So we end with address inside write and read funtions ?

That&#146;s ok for me.

 

So if I read everything well:

i2c.setspeed(id, speed)
i2c.write(id, address, data)
i2c.read(id, address, maxbytes)



For repeated start case, I think there is no issue with such device, because
repeated start is a trick to avoid to send a stop and thus permit to  keep
the control in case of multiple master.

So devices that support repeated start ALSO supports &#147;stop and resend
start&#148;.

I&#146;ve read it on a website, but can&#146;t re-find the address.

 

Bogdan are you ok with this?

If yes can we define the C interface so we could have a try?

I&#146;ve got 5 I2C device to test here, that can be a good test J

 

Reading their doc so far, I see no issue with such interface.

 

Regards,

Laurent

You are right, however Wikipedia is an easier read (at least for me) than a
formal spec.

 

What would be really nice is an I2C book equivalent to Wilfred Voss's  A
Comprehensive Guide to the Controller Area Network, which discusses
&quot;gotchas&quot; in the CAN standards document.  I did some searching, and didn't
find anything equivalent.

 

That's probably because I2C is really an extremely simple bus, orders of
magnitude less complex than CAN. I imagine that it's a bit hard to fill a
book with only I2C material :) The fact that different manufacturers choose
to implement it in an overly complex manner is a different problem.

 

Best,

Bogdan

True. In reality, I2C does not define the data protocol format at all
- that is left to the device manufacturers to decide.

It seems to me that we're looking at the three controllers we know,
the handful of devices we have seen, and are trying to find common
patterns between them. The risk with this is the devices we don't know
about - and if you're implementing a generic I2C interface for a
world-class language, we're only likely to succeed in covering the few
cases we've seen.

A different way to approach the problem is to start from the
definition of I2C protocol and make primitives that reflect that,
ensuring that we cover all possibilities including devices that are
not among those we happen to have used so far.

Wikipedia says:

----------
There are four potential modes of operation for a given bus device,
although most devices only use a single role and its two modes:
   master transmit &#151; master node is sending data to a slave
   master receive &#151; master node is receiving data from a slave
   slave transmit &#151; slave node is sending data to the master
   slave receive &#151; slave node is receiving data from the master
----------

Ok, nothing very new here.  Then it says:

----------
I&#178;C defines three basic types of messages, each of which begins with a
START and ends with a STOP:
   Single message where a master writes data to a slave;
   Single message where a master reads data from a slave;
   Combined messages, where a master issues at least two reads and/or
writes to one or more slaves.

In a combined message, each read or write begins with a START and the
slave address. After the first START, these are also called repeated
START bits; repeated START bits are not preceded by STOP bits, which
is how slaves know the next transfer is part of the same message.
----------

Then there are some other protocols built using I2C which further
limit the message structures:

----------
Pure I&#178;C systems support arbitrary message structures.
SMBus is restricted to nine of those structures, such as read word N
and write word N, involving a single slave.
PMBus extends SMBus with a Group protocol, allowing multiple such
SMBus transactions to be sent in one combined message. The terminating
STOP indicates when those grouped actions should take effect.
----------

Let's assume for the moment that we want to provide an I2C interface,
not an SMBus or PMBus one. If we get our I2C primitives right, we can
be sure that these more highly defined protocols can be implemented as
a Lua library that uses it if necessary.


&gt;<i> 1. init( id, speed )
</I>&gt;<i> 2. write( id, i2caddr, devaddr, bytes ) (could be simply 'write( id,
</I>&gt;<i> i2caddr, bytes )' but I want to make it symetrical with number 3 below).
</I>
Why?


&gt;<i> 3. read( id, i2caddr, devaddr, numbytes )
</I>
&gt;<i> 4. query (id, i2caddr)
</I>
I had been considering the register address inside the slave device as
just part of the transmitted data, not as part of I2C protocol.
In particular, the device register address, in the examples I've seen,
can be one, two or three bytes, so you'd need to include a devaddr_len
field as well. But that has nothing to do with I2C, just with the way
that certain devices we have seen use it.
I2C does not define the data format in use; the
write-address-then-read-data is just the way that one or two specific
devices use it.

That said, the AVR32 hardware also mimics this, allowing you to send
one, two or three bytes of addressing info and then automatically
sending a second start bit and address and switching into reading
mode.

10-bit slave addressing (instead of 7-bit slave addressing) is another
issue.  It is done thus:
Slave address = 1 1 1 1 0 a9 a8 R/W
First data byte = a7 a6 a5 a4 a3 a2 a1 a0
(Slave addresses 1111XXXX are reserved for extensions like this)

But both of these can be covered by a 7-bit address and arbitrary
data, leaving it up to the user:
to put the device register address at the start of their data
packet(s) or, for 10-bit addressing, to specify the reserved 11110AAR
address and put the other byte of the address into the start of the
data.
Again, if the Lua I2C interface is right, we know that we will be able
to write Lua functions to cover these cases.


So what does that leave us with?  Well, the I2C specification, which
has three primitives:
   Single message where a master writes data to a slave;
   Single message where a master reads data from a slave;
   Combined messages, where a master issues at least two reads and/or
writes to one or more slaves.

The &quot;one or more slaves&quot; is a bit surprising: it implies that a
combined message with multiple starts can address several different
slavesand that we've only seen examples that use the same slave
address (read device register, or read EEPROM contents at a specified
address).

It's asp interesting that the first two cases, the single messages,
are special cases of the combined messages, with only one data item
inside them, so if we provide a single combined message primitive,
that allows us to do everything I2C.
Anything less that this only addresses a subset of I2C devices - the
ones that we happen to have seen.

What does that suggest for a Lua interface? Well, we can encoding a
single message as a table and the combined message either as a table
of single messages or as a varargs list of them.

The single message would contain the 7-bit slave address, a bool
saying whether we are reading or writing (true for &quot;reading&quot;, since
the I2C &quot;read/write&quot; bit is high for a read).
If it's a read, we'll then need the maximum number of bytes to read.
It it's a write, we'll then need the number of bytes to send and the
data itself, which can both be encoded in a singLua string.

The return value for each message would be:
For each read message, the number of bytes actually read and the data
itself (these two can be expressed as a string, since Lua strings are
8-bit clean and encode the string length)
For each write message, the number of bytes actually written.

The combined messages are then either a table of single messages
returning a table of results, or a varargs list of them returning a
varargs list of results.
I don't have enough practice with Lua to know which is more
convenient, or if it's practical to accept both variants.

So, as an example, to write a byte value to a location in a 24LC32
EEPROM we need a single message, For clarity, I'll use the vargargs
and multiple return syntax:

function eeprom_write_byte(id, chip_select, address, datum)
 -- id = i2c bus id
 -- chip_select = 0..7
 -- address = 0..65535
 -- datum = 0..255 (a number)
 local slave_address = 0x50 + chip_select
 local ah, al = bit.rshift( address, 8 ), bit.band( address, 255)
 nwritten = i2c.transfer( id, [ i2c.WRITE, slave_address,
string.char(ah, al, datum) ] )
 assert( nwritten == 3 )
end

To read a byte from such an EEPROM we need a combined message with a
write and a read:

function eeprom_read_byte(id, chip_select, address)
 -- id = i2c bus id
 -- chip_select = 0..7
 -- address = 0..65535
 local slave_address = 0x50 + chip_select
 local ah, al = bit.rshift( address, 8 ), bit.band( address, 255)
 wresult, rresult = i2c.transfer( id,
   [ i2c.WRITE, slave_address, string.char(ah, al) ],
   [ i2c.READ, slave_address, 1 ]
 )
 if ( wresult ~= 2 or #rresult ~= 1) then return nil end
 return string.code(rresult)
end

Here, I'm using 7-bit addresses so write 7-bit address 0x50 to encode
the 8-bit EEPROM command byte 1010aaaR.

The &quot;query&quot; or &quot;probe&quot; operation is implemented in the example code
I've seen as a write message with 0 data in it, which succeeds or
fails according to whether the slave address gets acked or not. To add
this to the above model, we could say that if nobody acknowledges the
command byte (containing the slave address), we return nil instead of
0.


Well, thanks for following my thought process, but the result looks
very different from all the other eLua module interfaces, none of
which take tables as parameters, and none of which return multiple
results.
Anything less than this is not capable of expressing the full I2C
protocol, so the next choice is whether we want to be able to express
the I2C protocol or just the common cases of it for the devices we
know?

I know the rest of the eLua modules just provide the things that most
people want most frequently with minimum fuss, so restricting the I2C
interface to the common cases that we know is more in keeping with the
other eLua module interfaces.

Another option is simply not to support combined data packets.   I see
you can use the 24LC32 EEPROMs just by writing the memory address in
one packet with no data bytes to write, then issuing a &quot;read&quot; command
in a second and it remembers the memory address from one operation to
the next.
The DS1337 Real Time Clock can be used the same way and on the AVR32
we can just not use their clever self-reversing hardware.

Does anyone know of an I2C device that *needs* combined messages (with
repeated start bits) to work?  If not, Bogdan's suggestion is close
(modulo the strange desire for read/write function parameter symmetry
and without the variable-length device register address, which is just
data).

If we can dump combine messages, we can use:

i2c.setspeed(id, speed)
id = which I2C bus to talk on
speed = a number in Hz.
Returns: the actual speed set (or nil on error?)

i2c.write(id, address, data)
address = the 7-bit slave address
data = a string
Returns: an integer if the write was successful, reflecting the number
of bytes written
       nil if the slave did not respond to its address

i2c.read(id, address, maxbytes)
maxbytes = the maximum number of bytes to read (and acknowledge)
Returns: a string containing the data that was returned.
       nil if the address byte was not acknowledged

It would then be an option to provide packet assemblers to do the
other things that can be implemented using these:
- probe(id, address) is write(id, address, &quot;&quot;)
- read/write value from/to device register with address of length 1, 2
or 3 bytes
- other?
but these can be written in Lua or C, as you prefer, using the
single-message read/write primitives.

The EEPROM examples then become:

-- Write a byte to a 24LS32, returning true on success, false on failure
function eeprom_write_byte(id, chip_select, address, datum)
 -- id = i2c bus id
 -- chip_select = 0..7
 -- address = 0..65535
 -- datum = 0..255 (a number)
 local slave_address = 0x50 + chip_select
 local ah, al = bit.rshift( address, 8 ), bit.band( address, 255)
 return ( i2c.write( id, slave_address, string.char(ah, al, datum) ) == 3 )
end

-- Read a byte from a 24LS32, returning a 1-byte string on success or
nil on failure
function eeprom_read_byte(id, chip_select, address)
 -- id = i2c bus id
 -- chip_select = 0..7
 -- address = 0..65535
 local slave_address = 0x50 + chip_select
 local ah, al = bit.rshift( address, 8 ), bit.band( address, 255 )
 if i2c.write( id, slave_address, string.char(ah, al) ) ~= 2 then
   return nil
 end
 local result = i2c.read( id, slave_address, 1 )
 if #result ~= 1 then return nil end
 return result
end



&gt;&gt;<i> My own difficulty with changing the i2c interfaces is that I wouldn't
