<PRE>Hello list,

&gt;<i> Hi
</I>&gt;<i>  I assume you all know about the loss of the elua issue tracker and
</I>&gt;<i> wiki contents.
</I>

I assume not, since this was not announced, because there is no final status
or a decent report we can make about that yet and also because of personal
time and engagement limitations.
But you are right, I should have at least explained a bit more what happened
(which I will) and haven't done this yet for another series of reasons.


&gt;<i>  I only found out today, a month after the event,
</I>&gt;<i> because I tried to follow a link in our documentation to the full bug
</I>&gt;<i> report and found that my username didn't exist any more.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Not exactly. You found today that your (actually all) username/password was
not valid and I explained you needed to register again, after what I raised
your status to &quot;developer&quot; on the projects and informed you privately.
During the weeks that the tracker was offline, there was a message online
explaining what has happened and as I received a large number of pvt
messages, I thought that tracker users were aware of this. I also remember
mentioning this to Sergio and I (possibly wrongly) assumed he would inform
your Team.


&gt;<i>  I'm writing to let you know that I've recovered from Google's cache
</I>&gt;<i> the short listing of all issues that were open on 13 May 2011. For
</I>&gt;<i> some of them there is also the full description.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After half a day of work on this, I am now confident that this list
</I>&gt;<i> contains only the issues that were open on 13 May 2011 and that it
</I>&gt;<i> lists all the issues that were open on that date.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Thanks for the efforts Martin. I didn't know you would go in this direction,
as the only thing you mentioned to me yesterday was that you could do some
data-recovering work at the cost of 25 Euros / hours, your cost for Open
Source projects as you explained and to which I answered that unfortunately
we can not afford it at this moment (but I'm working on this).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This has been a lobotomy to the project, made worse by the failure to
</I>&gt;<i> say publicly what had happened.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
While I agree that I could and should have explained in some more detail
what has happened, even not knowing precisely the current status (I am in NY
and a team in Rio is working on this) and having may other pvt-life
limitations at this moment, I really think these kind of conclusions and
badly chosen words, are much more harmful to the list and to the project
than any of our faults and misfortunes.

You could at least have waited a couple of days, as I clearly told you that
I was getting ready (and anxious) to make it clear and explain it to the
community in my pvt answer to your questions.

In the intervening month between the mysterious &quot;Is there anybody here
&gt;<i> with good knowledge of MySQL and InnoDB&quot;
</I>

Why is it so mysterious ?
All I wanted to know is what was asked, if there was anybody with good
knowledge of MySQL and InnoDB and with enough time, patience and curiosity
to answer if some help was possible. I had one answer from James who,
despite of his equal lack of time, has been very helpful with his skills,
with his usual $0.00/hr tax for Open Source projects.

and me finding out today what
&gt;<i> happened through personal experience, then private mail, many of the
</I>&gt;<i> full bug entries have expired from the Google cache. Admitting your
</I>&gt;<i> problems publicly is good Catholic humility!
</I>

Please don't bring religious topics to this list.
While we certainly share great values like being humble and others, these
may not necessarily come from a specific religion or from any religion at
all.


&gt;<i> Hiding them, to be
</I>&gt;<i> discovered later by other means, makes you look devious, secretive and
</I>&gt;<i> more concerned about your public image than about the project itself.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I apologise if someone else felt that something was &quot;hidden&quot; here. It was
certainly and definitely not.
One can always blame the always slower-than-desirable rhythm we are able to
impose to the project, because none of us live from it or are able to treat
the problems immediately, specially big ones like this. But being accused of
hiding something from the community is another story.
Again, there was a message on the tracker page for a couple of weeks and I
answered all the pvt messages that came to me with the explanations I had
and still have, including your always interested and helpful questions. It
was my fault not figuring out this would not be enough and not finding more
time to make it clear.

elua-dev are your friends, not your public.
&gt;<i>
</I>
I never felt it differently or wanted to treat the great community we have
in such a way.
Also, we've never been treated by any of our friends like we're being
treated by you.

This is a good moment to drop tracker.eluaproject.net and create a bug
&gt;<i> tracker and wiki on elua.googlecode.com
</I>

Thanks for the suggestion. We have other plans though, as we largely prefer
to have a Redmine-based tracker.
We will definitely move our host servers from PUC-Rio to a more professional
service and we're working on this (==finding a way to fund the higher costs)


&gt;<i> They keep three full copies of all data in different datacenters, any
</I>&gt;<i> individual can download and save the wiki contents using Mercurial
</I>&gt;<i> $ hg clone <A HREF="https://wiki.mizar32.googlecode.com/hg">https://wiki.mizar32.googlecode.com/hg</A> hg-wiki
</I>&gt;<i> and it seems you can even backup the issue tracker contents using this API
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.softpedia.com/get/Programming/SDK-DDK/Google-Code-Issue-Tracker-API.shtml">http://www.softpedia.com/get/Programming/SDK-DDK/Google-Code-Issue-Tracker-API.shtml</A>
</I>&gt;<i> so even if Google goes bankrupt, simplemachines doesn't have to.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Nice, thanks for the infos and links.
I really and sincerely appreciate your code and brainstorming contributions
and I hope I the project can please you again one day.

I apologise again if I made someone else as angry and I'll really try to get
more infos (from Rio) and some time (yes, we used to have a life besides
eLua :) to explain in more detailed what happened and what is being done to
try to recover the data.

But not before I recover from this.
