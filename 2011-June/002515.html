You can't. It turns out that the AVR32 TWI silicon is pretty limited
in what it can do.
The datasheet is here
<A HREF="http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc32058.pdf">http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc32058.pdf</A>
with the TWI chapter starting at page 220.

As master, all it can do is:
- write one or more data bytes to a slave, then stop
- read one or more data bytes from a slave, then stop
- write one, two or three data bytes to a slave, then a repeated
start, then read one or more data bytes from the same slave, then stop

It cannot do:
- arbitrary repeated start sequences, so it can't synchronize multiple
data acquisition devices
- probing for the presence of devices by writing the address and no
data bytes. Their SDK's example code for twi_probe() just sends a
single byte with value 0, hoping that writing a 0 bytes doesn't do
anything funny to the probed devices.

You can only implement full I2C on AVR32 by bit-banging the clock and
data pins as GPIO lines.

&gt;<i> On LM3S it should be:
</I>&gt;<i> platform_i2c_start_and_send_address(0, address)
</I>&gt;<i> platform_i2c_send_byte( 0, false, &amp;data,     20);
</I>&gt;<i> platform_i2c_recv_byte( 0, true,  &amp;data_rcv, 50); //true means stop.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You mean that i2c send can't be called 2 consecutive times on avr32?
</I>
&quot;LMS3&quot; is a chip, not a software library, and chips don't have function calls.
Maybe you're talking about the LMS3 SDK library functions? I don't know those.

The Atmel SDK only has read() write() functions, which each emit
complete transfers from the START to the STOP bit.
It implements the write-then-read-with-repeated-start with some weird
&quot;internal device address&quot; and &quot;internal device address size&quot; bit
fields in a transfer config structure, and it prefixes these 1, 2 or 3
bytes to the data proper. But I wouldn't want to infect the eLua API
with this nonsense; I'd just say that if they try to do a send-recv
and send more than three bytes, then the transfer fails on AVR32.


That seems to leave the folloing options:

1) Redefine the eLua I2C APIs to express full I2C transfers as an
arbitrary sequence of sends and receives.

This makes for a much more complex API, requiring a table of tables or
a varargs list of tables, each encoding slave_address, direction and
data (for send) or nbytes (for receive). That seems out of keeping
with the rest of eLua, but it does ensure that any I2C device can
definitely be driven by eLua, and ensures that protocols built on top
of I2C can definitely be implemented using it (SMBus, ACPI etc).

2) Leave the interface as it is and implement I2C on AVR32 as a
bit-banging interface, completely forgetting their TWI hardware.

This also impacts on future implementations for other hardware that
does anything higher-level that &quot;send a start&quot; &quot;send a byte&quot; &quot;send a
stop&quot;.

3) Redefine the eLua I2C APIs to give the 3 common cases of send,
receive and send-then-receive-with-repeated-start

That would be something like
platform_i2c_master_exists(unsigned id)
actual_speed = platform_i2c_master_setup(unsigned id, u32 speed)
success = platform_i2c_master_send(unsigned id, u8 slave_address, char
*send_buf, u32 nbytes_to_send)
success = platform_i2c_master_recv(unsigned id, u8 slave_address, char
*recv_buf, u32 nbytes_to_receive)
success = platform_i2c_master_send_recv(unsigned id, u8 slave_address,
char *send_buf, u32 nbytes_to_send, char *recv_buf, u32
nbytes_to_receive)

Where &quot;success&quot; indicates that the slave acknowledged its address and
all the sent bytes were acknowledged.

&quot;probe&quot; becomes &quot;send(slave, NULL, 0)&quot;

The Lua interface needs redefining too, to express each kind of whole
transfer in a single function call instead of the current granular
interface.

These are pretty easy to implement in terms of the existing start(),
send_byte(), recv_byte() stop() primitives, or whatever your SDK
provides.

I suggest calling them platform_i2c_master_*  to leave the door open
to adding slave functionality in future without having to redefine the
existing master functions.  Note that some devices have single I2C
interfaces that can be switched between master and slave modes, while
others have separate master and slave hardware interfaces.
