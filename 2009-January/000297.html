</I>
Yeah, the way to do this without losing detail would be to use  
floating point.  I'm not adverse to the idea that just returning raw  
results is appropriate, since in a lot of cases one is going to do  
some additional conversion anyways.  At least on the LM3S board I have  
the ADC is 0-3V, so, in most cases, I'd likely have some sort of op- 
amp arrangement to take whatever signal I had as a source and remap it  
onto that range.  In such a situation, pre-conversion isn't all that  
useful.  I'm not sure, overall, how many applications end up doing  
additional conversion or not.  One thing that may make sense is to be  
able to let the programmer know what the bit depth is, or what the max  
and min readable values are, similar to how one can set timers?

I think all you would need would be maxval, because I don't know of  
any ADCs that will return negative values.  Does that seem reasonable?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Another item is:  If I do a single shot conversion, and then  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> subsequently call the function to get a sample, should default  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> behavior be to keep returning the last result?  I've found that at  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> least with the Stellaris platform the results are stored in a FIFO,  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so the first time I get my result, and the second time I get a  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> default value (presumably telling me that the FIFO is empty).  Any  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thoughts?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure I understand this. If you call a function to get a
</I>&gt;<i> sample, it should read a new sample and return it. What would be the
</I>&gt;<i> point of returning the previous sample?
</I>
Well, I guess what I was asking was, what to do in order to make  
behavior consistent across platforms.  I suppose what I should do is  
throw an error based on however a particular platform indicates the  
sample buffer is empty.
