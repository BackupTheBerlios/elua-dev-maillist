<PRE>Hi,

Interesting question, I didn't try this. It shouldn't matter at all,
as the bytecode is exactly the same, only its interpretation differs
with LTR. But of course, we need to test this first.
As for the instructions on cross-lua.py, look at the attached file. It
used to be in the docs/ subdirectory, but something wrong happened to
it after we converted the docs (it's still in the PDF, only very well
hidden and with a very bad formatting).

Best,
Bogdan

Cross-compiling Lua programs
================================================================================
&quot;Cross compilation&quot; is the process of compiling a program on one system for a 
different system. For example, the process of compiling the eLua binary image on
a PC is cross-compiling. Lua can be cross-compiled, too. By cross-compiling Lua
to bytecode on a PC and executing the resulting bytecode directly on your eLua
board you have two advantages:

- speed: the Lua interpreter on the eLua board doesn't have to compile your Lua
  source code, it just executes the compiled bytecode
- memory: this is more important. If you're exectuing bytecode directly, no more
  memory is &quot;wasted&quot; on the eLua board for compiling the Lua code to bytecode.
  Many times this could be a &quot;life saver&quot;. If you're trying to run Lua code
  directly on your board and you're getting &quot;not enough memory&quot; errors, you 
  might be able to overcome this by compiling the Lua program on the PC and 
  running the bytecode instead.

But for this cross-compilation to work, the two Lua targets must be compatible
(they should have the same data types, with the same size, and the same memory
representation). This isn't completely true for Intel and ARM targets, as gcc
for ARM uses a very specific representation for double numbers (called FPA
format) by default, which makes bytecode files generated on the PC useless on
ARM boards. To overcome this, a &quot;Lua cross-compilation&quot; patch was posted on the
Lua mailing list a while ago, and it was further modified as part of the eLua
project to work with ARM targets. This is how to use it (the following 
instructions were tested on Linux, not Windows, but they should work on Windows 
too with little or no tweaking):

- first, make sure that your PC has already a build system intalled (gcc,
  binutils, libc, headers...). You'll also need &quot;scons&quot;. The good news is that 
  you should have it already installed, since otherwise you won't be able to 
  build even regular eLua.

- from the eLua base directory, issue this command:

  $ scons -f cross-lua.py

  You should get a file called &quot;luac&quot; in the same directory after this.

- to compile your Lua code (in &lt;source&gt;.lua), issue this command:

  $ ./luac -s -ccn float_arm 64 -o &lt;source&gt;.luac &lt;source&gt;.lua
  if you're using &quot;regular&quot; (floating point) Lua, or:

  $ ./luac -s -ccn int 32 -o &lt;source&gt;.luac &lt;source&gt;.lua
  if you're using int-ony Lua.

- that's it! You can use the resulting file (&lt;source&gt;.luac) in two ways:

  - &quot;recv&quot; it (docs/the_elua_shell.txt)
  - copy it to the ROM file system (docs/the_rom_file_system.txt)
