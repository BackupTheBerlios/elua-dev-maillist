This brings up some basic issues with abstraction.  Recently I've had  
the (not so great, because of the platform) privilege of helping some  
students work with Basic Stamp for projects they were working on that  
involved some servos.  A quick and easy way to control these is using  
the PULSOUT command.  During the project a few of them had their  
boards burn out and they were replaced with ones at higher clock  
rates, and what I found out was that the values being used with  
PULSOUT were directly tied to clock rate, so they had to guess at the  
ranges needed to control the servos.  To me this represents a bad  
tradeoff of &quot;knowing your hardware,&quot; especially with something geared  
towards accessibility for beginners.  On the other hand, with Arduino,  
this is handled completely differently, the hardware details are  
completely abstracted away.  One passes angles for the servo instead  
of pulse length related to clock cycles or even millisecond length.   
What's bizarre about this is that Arduino basically uses C, and  
compiles down to AVR assembler, and Basic Stamp is interpreted.

Abstraction, almost much by definition, is limiting in some way. The  
benefits one gets are in making something easier, that otherwise would  
not have been.  In some cases you might want direct access to how the  
timers are implemented and set things yourself.  One major downside to  
this is that it's annoying to port, and may make for rather messy  
implementations.  If you switch to another micro because it's a bit  
faster or has hardware support for something that was previously being  
emulated, you might have to tweak all of your magic numbers over  
again.  In order to get around this you might also end up building  
some sort of abstraction in Lua instead of C.  If the feature is  
useful in many cases, perhaps the module should be extended, while  
keeping the abstraction consistent, to include the feature.  If the  
feature is a one off, you could still write your own custom module in  
C.  I think it would be nicer to keep the Lua side of the interface  
generally the same across platforms where possible, with the exception  
of the platform specific modules.

One other thought though:  If a feature, on some platforms, requires  
emulation, and that emulation is particularly expensive over a full  
hardware implementation, it might be nice to know if eLua is using  
that in emulation rather than in hardware.  Perhaps this could somehow  
be tied in with the pd module, either in the form of a list of  
hardware supported features, like when one looks at /proc/cpuinfo on  
linux, or something else?

Just a few thoughts.
