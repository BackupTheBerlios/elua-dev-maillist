<PRE>Hi,

Glad to see things are moving in this area.

On Fri, Jan 9, 2009 at 7:48 PM, Mike Panetta &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/elua-dev">panetta.mike at gmail.com</A>&gt; wrote:

&gt;<i> That sounds pretty good.  I had a slightly different approach in mind, but
</I>&gt;<i> I am not sure how you would feel about it.  Basically the idea is we would

</I>&gt;<i> words, we would export only a (minimal compatible) Lua level interface,
</I>&gt;<i> instead of the current way of exporting a generic (minimal) C interface.
</I>&gt;<i> Each platform would be required to adhere to the minimal Lua interface (IE
</I>&gt;<i> define the Lua module at the platform level), but at its discretion add
</I>&gt;<i> additional functionality specific to that platform.
</I>

Having a generic C interface has advantages not related to Lua. For example,
writing &quot;generic drivers&quot; for devices like serial ADCs/DACs, or SD/MMC cards
in SPI mode. Each of these can fully benefit from the platform interface.


&gt;<i> In this manner we could possibly give access to the various platform
</I>&gt;<i> modules in terms of functionality, like tmr.has_a(16BIT_TIMER), and,
</I>&gt;<i> tmr.tmr(TIMER1).capable_of(PULSE_CAPTURE). Since all timers at the top level
</I>&gt;<i> basically provide the same kinds of functionality (but may not export it the
</I>&gt;<i> same way) this very well could work.
</I>

Your interface seems to be &quot;more OOP&quot;, but IMO the code example above
doesn't make it look more useful. For example, I'm actually trying to _hide_
the fact that the platform has 8, 16 or 32 bit timers. As an eLua
programmer, I shouldn't care about that too much, as I just want to use the
timers for delays, or measuring elapsed time. Therefore, all I'd need (in an
ideal world :) ) would be &quot;tmr.delay&quot; and &quot;tmr.gettimediff&quot;. Your approach
does have the advantage of hiding some platform details from the user, in
that he can actually ask the system to provide a timer that can do
PULSE_CAPTURE without having to look through the datasheet trying to figure
out which one does. This is something we should consider, but it would
require a very good feature set (by &quot;feature&quot; I mean something like
PULSE_CAPTURE) specified for all peripherals. Not an easy task.


&gt;<i> An example usage might be something like:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 16bit_timers = tmr.has_a(16BIT_TIMER) -- returns an array of static
</I>&gt;<i> constant 'timer' objects
</I>
The above code would return 8 timer objects on the LM3S CPUs with 4 timer
&gt;<i> modules, or 8 timer objects on an STM32F103ZE chip.
</I>

Please don't take this the wrong way, as it's not in anyway a critique, I'm
just curious: am I right in presumimg that you're more accustomed to desktop
programming than to embedded programming? I'm asking because you just
allocated an array of objects that would steal a bit more of that oh so
precious RAM :) You gave me an idea though: having a method called
&quot;getcount&quot; or something similar for each module that would return the number
of available resources of that kind could be useful.


&gt;<i> 16bit_timers[1]:pair(twin) -- pairs a 16bit timer with its twin. The 2
</I>&gt;<i> timers (and the associated 32bit pair) must be in the 'unlocked' state.
</I>&gt;<i> Returns the static const 32bit timer object associated with the pair, or nil
</I>&gt;<i> if an error occured.
</I>

Another interesting problem here. 16bit_timers:pair is a very specific
method (from all the platforms I tried, LM3S is the only one able to
&quot;concatenate&quot; two 16-bit timer channels into a single 32-bit channel). So in
your view, the timer object would get together all the capabilities from all
the platforms inside it, thus letting any platform add any capability (which
was the original ideea, I know :) ). This has some drawbacks in my oppinion:

- potential confusion. If some on (say) AT91SAM tries to do &quot;pair&quot; and gets
a nil, it might not understand why at first.
- documentation issues: having to specify for each function on what platform
it works/doesn't work can be both hard to write and hard to read.
- false sense of portability: if someone sees a code that says
&quot;16bit_timers[1]:pair(twin)&quot; he might think something between the lines of
&quot;cool, eLua can do pair, so I can get any board I want and enjoy this&quot;
(let's face it: given a situation like this most people aren't going to RTFM
until it's too late :) ). But when you say:

lm3s.tmr.pair(0)
tmr.delay(0,delay)

it's a very strong hint that this code might not work on anything else than
LM3S.

16bit_timers[1]:lock() -- Marks a timer as used, so other processes (or
&gt;<i> coding errors) do not interrupt a timers config.
</I>&gt;<i> 16bit_timers[1]:unlock() -- Marks a timer as free to be reconfigured for
</I>&gt;<i> other purposes.
</I>

This, on the other hand, is a very interesting idea. Locking/unlocking
resources is gold, since you'll always know what resource you can or cannot
use. Especially important in larger applications, where it's easier to loose
track of resources. Of course, it also introduces a problem: if you call
lock(), you must remember to call unlock(). C++ coders know that this is a
problem, since they frequently forget to deallocate resources in their class
destructors (I should know :) ). Or course, in Lua you could let the garbage
collector help you, and even if you don't it's much easier to track down the
problem, so this is something to keep in minde.

Best,
Bogdan

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi again,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As most of you know by now, our platform interface is generic enough to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implemented by any eLua target. The unfortunate side effect of this is that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all the (potentially cool) specific features of each platform/board are left
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> forgotten, and there's no way to access them directly. As some (probably
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> most) people would gladly sacrifice portability over the possibility of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> taking full advantage of their CPUs, we need to find a way to address this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> need.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is my proposal:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - every platform will have a module which name is the same as the platform
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> name (&quot;lm3s&quot; for LM3S, &quot;stm32&quot; for STM32, you got the picture :) )
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - this module will have two types of &quot;submodules&quot; (for want a better term;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what I mean is that each module will be able to embed other modules inside
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it):
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   1. submodules with the same name as the &quot;standard&quot; modules. For example:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lm3s.uart, lm3s.tmr, lm3s.pio and so on. These will add to the functionality
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of the &quot;standard&quot; modules by providing platform-specific functions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   2. submodules that implement features found only on that platform/board.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Dado's &quot;disp&quot; module is a very good example of this. By having a module
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;lm3s.disp&quot; we know for sure that we're reffering to a display that can be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> found on the LM3S board. This is a temporary solution, as a generic display
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> architecture would be a much better choice, but it's still good enough for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> our needs IMO.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What say you?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Best,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Bogdan
