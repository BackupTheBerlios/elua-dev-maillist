<PRE>This sounds great to me.  A perfect compromise. I agree with the attributes
not being taken lightly, but I think if we can split them in to smaller
sections we would be ok.

&gt;<i> OK, so let's summarize: most people see a benefit in both approaches
</I>&gt;<i> (Mike's and main),  and I'm one of them :). So let's try to find the best of
</I>&gt;<i> both worlds here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What Alex proposed is OK and looks very good from an abstraction point of
</I>&gt;<i> view, but I don't want to add another layer to eLua. I'm really trying to
</I>&gt;<i> keep eLua's design principles in line with Lua's: simple, minimalistic even,
</I>&gt;<i> yet completely functional.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I like most in this thread is Mike's idea about keeping capabilities,
</I>&gt;<i> also what I dislike most is his idea about explicitly querying for the
</I>&gt;<i> forementioned capabilities :) What if we skip the query step? After all, our
</I>&gt;<i> backend already knows the capabilities, so the programmer can simply ask for
</I>&gt;<i> what he needs and get an object ID in return. An example:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *local uart_id, errmsg = uart.get{ speed = uart.SPEED_115200, flowctrl =
</I>&gt;<i> uart.HW, mode = uart.M8N1, type = uart.RS485}
</I>&gt;<i> -- check for errors here
</I>&gt;<i> uart.send( uart_id, ... ) -- use the rest of the platform interface as
</I>&gt;<i> usual
</I>&gt;<i> .............................................
</I>&gt;<i> uart.unlock( uart_id ) -- we're done with this UART
</I>&gt;<i> *
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, the query still happens, but this time is not explicit (as it
</I>&gt;<i> happens automagically in the backend), and I think this makes life much
</I>&gt;<i> easier for the end user. It can also take care of the locking/unlocking
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism that Mike proposed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to have something like this in eLua, but it requires a very good
</I>&gt;<i> understanding of all the attributes of all the peripherals from all the
</I>&gt;<i> platforms, which is not something that should be taken lightly (in fact I
</I>&gt;<i> think it's something quite difficult).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And James, what happened in BasicStamp will never happen in eLua, unless of
</I>&gt;<i> course aliens those pesy aliens FINALLY manage to take control of my mind
</I>&gt;<i> and modify the code for their evil purposes :) The platform interface will
</I>&gt;<i> ALWAYS use standard units (hertz, microseconds, stuff like this).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best,
</I>&gt;<i> Bogdan
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Very interesting discussion!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think James summarized the debate quite nicely. You just cannot have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> your cake and eat it in this situation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I personally see that there are important values on both sides of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> debate: standardizing things makes it easy and seamless to jump from one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> specific HW platform to another, while having Mike's check/execute mechanism
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would allow extracting best potential from the specifics of particular HW
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> platform.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In fact, i am convinced that both of these are needed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Here are some thoughts about this after reading the debate:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    why not have 2 levels of abstraction the following way:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    - Mike's idea of check/execute mechanism will be the lower level and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implemented directly in C
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    - Bogdan's more generic and &quot;worry-less&quot; interface will be the upper
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> level and *implemented in Lua*, and built *on top* of the Mike's layer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interfacing to it with the check/execute mechanism. This extra level of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> abstraction will be HW specific just like Mike's layer, this is necessary as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the items in Bogdan's generic layer will depend on default configuration
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> details of the specific HW platform (i.e best default timer would be a 32bit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one on a platform that has 32bit timers, and 16bit on a platform that only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> has 16bit timers, etc)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Example: Bogdan's layer implements a generic timer abstraction. This layer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> queries Mike's layer for types of timers available (of which Mike's layer is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> aware of) using a standardized querying mechanism, and also knows how to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> determine the best type for the default timer that would be used in Bogdan's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> layer as the default timer. Mike's layer knows how to supply hooks to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> various types of timers' actions that Bogdan's layer understands how to use.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What this solves: A user who wants to use a generic timer, goes ahead with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the standard (Bogdan's) timer abstraction and doesn't concern oneself with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> details like various checks (as Bogdan's layer takes care of all these
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> details in ways specific to particular HW platform)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A more advanced user, who wants to be &quot;closer to the metal&quot;, will use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Mike's layer directly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Potential gotchas and disadvantages:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - two layers instead of one, albeit only one layer is implemented in C,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the other one is all Lua.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Mike's check/execute mechanism has to be standardized
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - two sets of standards to maintain.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hope this helps somewhat

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Oh, but timers can do so much more then just generate delays.  This is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> why I proposed such a flexible interface.  As for caring what functionality
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> a platform has, IMO, since this is an embedded system and users would be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> writing software that is closer to the hardware, I would argue that an eLua
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> user *would* want to know if the timer was 8, 16, or 32 bits.  Even if they
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> are just doing delays, that knowledge would be invaluable in that it could
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> tell you minimum timer resolution and maximum timeout values.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> You're right, timers can do much more than just generate delays, I was
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> simplifying to make a point, the same principle applies to any timer
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> operation. As for your idea that the users would want to know what kind of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> hardware they're using, I could argue that since they're doing that, they
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> might as well know if their timers can do capture or not :), so querying for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> capabilities becomes kinda redundant in this context. And for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> minimum/maximum timer resolution, we already have
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> tmr.getmindelay/tmr.getmaxdelay. Which are much more useful in this
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> particular situation, since knowing if a timer is 8/16/32 bits tells only
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> half of the story, you'd also need the timer frequency and a calculator
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> somewhere :) This is why I still stand by my initial point, which I'd like
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to reformulate a bit: yes, the user should know his platform, he just
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> shouldn't care that much about it. To me it's more natural to call functions
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> like &quot;getmindelay&quot; that completely hide the hardware (and allow for other
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> neat stuff, like the virtual timers that I implemented recently) than to try
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to figure this out from the hardware. After all, Lua is a high level
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> language, and although the programmer does indeed use it at a level that's
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> very close to the hardware, he might not want to feel this. Much like most C
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> programmer out there don't want to feel that there's some assembly code
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> lurking in the shadows of their beautifully intended code blocks :)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This brings up some basic issues with abstraction.  Recently I've had the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (not so great, because of the platform) privilege of helping some students
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> work with Basic Stamp for projects they were working on that involved some
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> servos.  A quick and easy way to control these is using the PULSOUT command.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  During the project a few of them had their boards burn out and they were
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> replaced with ones at higher clock rates, and what I found out was that the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> values being used with PULSOUT were directly tied to clock rate, so they had
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to guess at the ranges needed to control the servos.  To me this represents
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> a bad tradeoff of &quot;knowing your hardware,&quot; especially with something geared
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> towards accessibility for beginners.  On the other hand, with Arduino, this
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> is handled completely differently, the hardware details are completely
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> abstracted away.  One passes angles for the servo instead of pulse length
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> related to clock cycles or even millisecond length.  What's bizarre about
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> this is that Arduino basically uses C, and compiles down to AVR assembler,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and Basic Stamp is interpreted.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Abstraction, almost much by definition, is limiting in some way. The
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> benefits one gets are in making something easier, that otherwise would not
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> have been.  In some cases you might want direct access to how the timers are
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> implemented and set things yourself.  One major downside to this is that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> it's annoying to port, and may make for rather messy implementations.  If
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> you switch to another micro because it's a bit faster or has hardware
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> support for something that was previously being emulated, you might have to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> tweak all of your magic numbers over again.  In order to get around this you
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> might also end up building some sort of abstraction in Lua instead of C.  If
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the feature is useful in many cases, perhaps the module should be extended,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> while keeping the abstraction consistent, to include the feature.  If the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> feature is a one off, you could still write your own custom module in C.  I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> think it would be nicer to keep the Lua side of the interface generally the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> same across platforms where possible, with the exception of the platform
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> specific modules.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> One other thought though:  If a feature, on some platforms, requires
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> emulation, and that emulation is particularly expensive over a full hardware
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> implementation, it might be nice to know if eLua is using that in emulation
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> rather than in hardware.  Perhaps this could somehow be tied in with the pd
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> module, either in the form of a list of hardware supported features, like
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> when one looks at /proc/cpuinfo on linux, or something else?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Just a few thoughts.
