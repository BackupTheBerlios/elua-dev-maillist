<PRE>Good questions and discussion points, James.  I'd be happy to  
elaborate on PyMite.

First, PyMite's first targets were 8-bit AVR microcontrollers with 64  
KB Flash and 8 KB RAM.  So the resources were *much* smaller than even  
eLua is targeting.  However, I have found that 8 KB of RAM is too  
small to do anything useful.  32 KB seems to be enough to do useful  
things according to 2 different reports from researchers in Germany  
and MIT.  But this means attaching external RAM to the AVR which is  
beyond the scope of the hobbyist (at whom I am targeting PyMite).   
Since PyMite's first incarnation in 2002, the variety of 32-bit  
microcontrollers has increased and their prices have fallen; now, 32  
and even 64 KB of SRAM is available on-board both ARM7 and AVR32  
devices.  These new devices are on par with what eLua runs on.  Right  
now PyMite (and a few developers) are begging me to develop PyMite to  
run on these devices with greater resources.

In my early background research, I found previous attempts to reduce  
Python (Pippy, PythonCE) required around 256 KB of RAM and 1 M of  
program memory... so a total rewrite was necessary.  I rewrote the  
internal datastructures to reduce runtime memory requirements.  I  
rewrote the core interpreter, picking one at a time which bytecodes  
would make the cut to be included.  And I wrote the tools needed to  
take a .pyc compiled on a PC and compress it to a smaller format for  
inclusion into the program memory.  Literally, EVERY design decision  
was to reduce size.  Python was a very hard language to make small...  
and I'd say I still don't have it quite right.

One thing I added to PyMite was a pretty slick and easy way to call C  
functions from Python.  I call them native functions.  Briefly stated,  
you write a Python module with function defs, but put the C code in  
the docstring of the function and &quot;pass&quot; for the function body.  An  
included, automated tool finds these native functions and builds them  
into the executable and makes the lookup tables so it just works.   
This method was a lot better for smaller targets than CPython's  
method.  Using SWIG was never an option.  Lua has an easy way to write  
C functions and call them.

Lua was designed from the very start to be embedded (into other  
programs as well as into smaller systems).  Python was designed for  
the desktop and is rather big.  Even if I grow PyMite to use 256 KB  
Flash and 64 KB SRAM, I don't think I'll be able to fit every Python  
feature into PyMite.  Whereas, just recently, I showed that the eLua  
interpreter (minus its parser/lexer) will fit in 64 KB Flash and 16 KB  
SRAM.  So, in this respect, I believe Lua has the edge for size.   
However, I believe that due to my focus on internal data structure  
size, a PyMite program will use less RAM during runtime (but I admit  
this is difficult to quantify).

PyMite is stack based, like CPython.  tinypy is register based, like  
Lua.  I joined the tinypy maillist specifically because it's approach  
(follow the Lua design, but use Python syntax) was what I thought I  
wanted to do for the next version of PyMite.  However, tinypy's  
developer is focused on the desktop target and speed for gaming.   
tinypy would need a fairly significant rewrite for it to run in a low- 
ram environment.

At this point, I believe eLua is in a great position: it offers the  
Lua language and useful modules.  I believe with further development  
PyMite could achieve a comparable level of ability as eLua on the same  
devices, but still not offer all of CPython's features (decorators,  
multiple inheritance, etc).  As a final note, I believe that since  
PyMite is completely re-implemented from scratch, it stands to  
introduce more design defects into the language.  So that is a  
drawback.  I haven't diffed eLua's src/lua directory against the  
standard Lua source tree, but I don't believe them to be vastly  
different.  So eLua has a high fidelity to the  Lua language and a  
common code base (fewer defects).

</I>&gt;<i> things I use Python for on the desktop, but it sounds like it is  
</I>&gt;<i> better suited to MCUs without having to carve out any large portions  
</I>&gt;<i> of functionality.  In particular, this means that the standard Lua  
</I>&gt;<i> documentation applies broadly to eLua, and that one can pretty much  
</I>&gt;<i> copy and paste a standard Lua script into eLua and have it work (so  
</I>&gt;<i> long as it doesn't use external modules not provided, or if the MCU
