<PRE>Hi to all.

I am with Micromint, a developer of embedded controllers in Florida. I
started following the eLua project recently and joined the eLua-dev list a
few days ago. The eLua roadmap offers functionality that is attractive in
many application environments. Congratulations to Bogdan and the eLua
community on the achievements so far!

Throughout the years, we have seen many interpreters in use with our
embedded controllers.

For a long time, Basic was a very popular choice in the microcontroller
world. In some application domains, it still is popular. One big advantage
is that the language can be implemented with very low resource requirements.
8051 Basic takes only 8 KB and allows access to most of the functionality of
that 8-bit MCU. Basic allowed users without a computer science background to
implement a fairly large amount of functionality in a very short time.

Specialized C interpreters also led to significant functionality and low
resource requirements. You can build a C interpreter for an MCU with all the
APIs required by a specialized application in a 32 KB binary. That is still
an alternative popular with users familiar with C. Of course, making the
interpreter general purpose or adding networking makes the interpreter
binary grow.

Python has become very popular, gradually replacing Basic and Java for many
applications. Even AI researchers now consider Python an acceptable
alternative to Lisp (see Peter Norvig's comments at
<A HREF="http://norvig.com/python-lisp.html">http://norvig.com/python-lisp.html</A>), something Java was never able to do.
The standard library implements a lot of functionality that leads to fast
code development but also results in relatively large resource requirements.
An old version of Python (1.5) was ported to the Palm some years ago
(Pippy). The binary plus library were around 400K and it had memory issues
in systems with less than 1 MB of RAM. Using popular Python libraries such
as PyLab was not feasible.

It may be difficult to implement the full Python standard library in
environments with 128 KB of flash and 64 KB of RAM, particularly if you also
need to include networking in that footprint. Yet a Python subset would
still be useful to many applications. For example, a chemist could code the
data acquisition for an experiment using a Python subset in an embedded
board that handles the sensors and actuators. The embedded Python
application could then periodically transfer the data via TCP/IP to a
workstation where it can be processed using a full Python implementation.
One big advantage there is that the chemist does not need to master two
languages and can apply his/her Python skills to the data acquisition
system.

Embedded Linux does offer an alternative for Python in embedded controllers.
Many embedded Linux boards now offer 64 MB of RAM and 1 GB of flash for a
relatively low cost. Besides more resources, many projects can take
advantage of a reliable multi-tasking operating system and many popular open
source applications. For many cases, embedded Linux is a good choice to run
Python applications in microcontrollers.

Lua has been popular as a scripting language to extend applications. It is
not as popular as Python so in many scenarios it would require users to
learn a new language. Yet its syntax is contemporary and its footprint is
relatively small. With eLua many practical applications are feasible even
within 128 KB of flash and 64 KB of RAM. The language is also simple to
extend. Applications that require specialized APIs for their hardware could
get a new eLua module working fairly quickly.

With interpreters you can implement a lot of functionality in a relatively
short time. The performance and capabilities are not as high as coding in C
or Assembler, but they can meet the requirements of many applications with
significantly less coding.
