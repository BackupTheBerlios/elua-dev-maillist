<PRE>So I've been thinking about how to accomplish burst sampling at a  
given rate (or background sampling).  The Stellaris ADCs are  
programmable in terms of selecting a sampling rate, but the range is  
pretty limited, and fairly fast (125 ksamples/s - 1 msample/s).  In  
order to do more arbitrary rates, I'll need to use a timer.  The issue  
I see is: what if I'm already using a timer, or multiple timers for  
some purpose?  In cases where something like this is needed should  
timers be reserved/locked?

I've not worked with all the other supported platforms, but from  
working with some other microcontrollers I think a timer will be  
needed.  In going with how things are already implemented  
(platform_uart_recv), I'm going to assume this is how I'll have to  
adjust things.  As such, I suppose the ADC API should be amended a  
bit, as follows:

void platform_adc_burst( unsigned id, u16* buf, unsigned count,  
unsigned timer_id, u32 frequency );

The current API then looks like this:

int platform_adc_exists( unsigned id );
u16 platform_adc_sample( unsigned id );
u16 platform_adc_maxval( unsigned id );
void platform_adc_start( unsigned id );
int platform_adc_is_done( unsigned id );
void platform_adc_set_mode( unsigned id, int mode );
void platform_adc_burst( unsigned id, u16* buf, unsigned count,  
unsigned timer_id, u32 frequency );

If continuous mode sampling is to run at a rate that isn't in the  
range of 125 ksamples to 1 msamples, we might either need to have the  
set_mode function accept a timer (which is less useful in the case of  
doing single-shot, but timers can be used that way :-)), or have  
another function like burst, but that isn't blocking, and has a  
corresponding stop function.

I'm also going to add a smoothing option, which in the context of  
single shot or continuous simply means that  enough samples must be  
averaged before the result is_done.  For burst, we could do this too,  
either as oversampling (i.e. each burst sample is actually 5 averaged  
values, that are available because we're actually sampling at 5 times  
the rate passed to adc_burst) or with a moving average filter.  For  
single shot, these would be the same, but they differ when we're  
talking about continuous or burst sampling.  One requires that  
filter_length samples be collected prior to each averaged sample being  
released, and the other runs at the sampling rate, as soon as  
filter_length samples are collected so that the moving average has  
enough data. Hmm...

The stellaris platform has hardware averaging, though it is designed  
for being used for oversampling, not just rolling averages.

This article does a decent job of outlining the issues:

I think for now I will implement smoothing as follows, using a moving  
average filter:
void platform_adc_set_smoothing( unsigned id, u8 length );
