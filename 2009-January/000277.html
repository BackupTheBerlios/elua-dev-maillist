<PRE>OK people, it seems that this got your interested :), so these are the gory
details. First a few words about the patch itself ; the text below is a
modified version of the text I used to present the first version of the
patch in the Lua list, but now we're talking about the second version of the
patch, which is better, fixes some very nasty bugs from V1 and has more
features.

================================================================================

Audience
========

For people that use Lua on desktops, this patch is probably of no interest,
as its purpose is to minimize RAM footprint (at the expense of
speed/executable size). If, on the other hand, you're trying to run Lua on a
resource contrained system (like a microcontroller) or in a sandboxed
environment, and you're more concerned with memory usage than with speed,
you might find this patch useful.

Motivation
==========

The main thing that drove me to write this patch is Lua's memory consumption
at startup (obtained by running lua -e &quot;print(collectgarbage'count')&quot;). It's
about 17k for regular Lua 5.1.4, and more than 25k for some of eLua's
platforms. These figures are mainly a result of registering many different
modules to Lua. Each time you register a module (via luaL_register) you
create a new table and populate it with the module's methods. But a table is
a read/write datatype, so luaL_register is quite inefficient if you don't
plan to do any write operations on that table later (adding new elements or
manipulating existing ones). I found that I almost never have to do any such
operations on a module's table after it was created, I just query it for its
elements. So, from the perspective of someone worried about memory usage,
I'd rather have a different type of table in this case, one that wouldn't
need any RAM at all, since it would be read only, so it could reside
entirely in ROM.
And there's one more thing related to this context: Lua's functions. While
Lua does have the concept of C functions, they still require data structures
that need to be allocated (see lua_pushcclosure in lapi.c for details), as
they can have upvalues or environments. Once again, this isn't something I
use often with eLua. Most of the times my functions (especially the ones
exported by a C module) are very simple, and they don't need upvalues or
environments at all. In conclusion, having a &quot;simpler&quot; function type would
improve memory usage.

Details
=======

The patch adds two new data types to Lua. Both or them are based on the
lightuserdata type already found in Lua, and they share the same basic
attributes: they don't need to be dynamically allocated (as they're just
pointers on steroids) and they're compared in the same way lightuserdatas
are compared (by value). And of course, they are not collectable, so the
garbage collector won't have anything to do with them. The new types are:

1. lightfunctions: these are &quot;simple&quot; functions, in the sense that they
can't have upvalues or environments. They are just pointers to regular C
functions. Other than that, you can use them from Lua just as you'd use any
other function.

2. ro(m)tables: these are read-only tables, but unlike the read-only tables
that one can already implement in Lua with metamethods, they have a very
specific property: they don't need any RAM at all. They are fully constant,
so they can be read directly from ROM. They have a number of special
features and limitations when compared with a regular table:

- rotables can only contain values of type &quot;lightfunction&quot;, lua_Number or
pointers to other rotables.
- you can't add/delete/modify elements from rotables (obviously).

*NEW IN V2: *

- you can use rotables as metatables for both &quot;regular&quot; tables and for Lua
types (via debug.setmetatable)
- rotabels can have another rotable (or itself) as a metatable
- rotabels can have both string and integer keys
- you can iterate over rotables with pairs/ipairs/next just as you do with
&quot;regular&quot; tables.

Just as with lightuserdata, you can only create lightfunctions and rotables
from C code, never from Lua itself.

How to use it
==========

The patch must be applied to an unmodified Lua 5.1.4 source tree. Once you
unpack the source tree and download the patch, do this:

$ cd lua-5.1.4
$ cp &lt;location&gt;/lua_tiny_ram.patch .
$ patch -p1 &lt; lua_tiny_ram.patch

Then edit lua-5.1.4/src/Makefile to set the optimization level for the
patch:

CFLAGS= -O2 -Wall $(MYCFLAGS) -DLUA_OPTIMIZE_MEMORY=x, where x can be:

0: this doesn't actually optimize anything, in just tries to keep the
patched version as close as possible to the unpatched version in terms of
speed and functionality. This passes the full Lua 5.1 test suite (see
&quot;Testing&quot; below for details).

1: this applies a moderate optimization, the resulting code takes less
memory and still passes the full test suite. In this mode most of the
standard libraries are modified to use lightfunctions instead of &quot;regular&quot;
functions, and some of them are &quot;converted&quot; to use rotables instead of
regular tables.

2: aggresive optimizations, this modifies the standard libraries even more
than it does at level 1. The IO library is modified to use the registry
instead of environments, thus making it more resource-friendly (the side
effect being that this mode doesn't support pipes). It also leaves the _G
table with a single method (__index) and sets it as its own metatable, so
all the &quot;standard&quot; Lua functions are now hidden behind a __index access.
This mode passes almost all the tests in the Lua 5.1 test suite, except for
a few tests from &quot;db.lua&quot; (which fail because the functions in &quot;io&quot; are now
lightfunctions and they can't have upvalues anymore) and a few more  from
&quot;nextvar.lua&quot; (which fail because of reasons I don't fully understand, but
they have to do with the fact that _G's only method is now __index).

To use it in your own code, call &quot;luaL_register_light&quot; instead of
&quot;luaL_register&quot; to register your module with lightfunctions istead of
regular functions. Also, you can completeley forget about registering your
module if you use rotables. See linit.c, mathlib.c and oslib.c for an
example of how to turn your regular code into code that uses rotables.

Results
=======

All of the results come from running &quot;lua -e &quot;print(collectgarbage'count')&quot;&quot;
from the command line.

*NOTE: these numbers are no longer perfectly accurate for version 2 of the
patch, but they're still pretty close to the real numbers.*

Regular Lua 5.1.4:           17.0966
Patched Lua 5.1.4, OPT = 0 : 17.0849 (the difference comes from a few small
changes in loadlib.c)
Patched Lua 5.1.4, OPT = 1 :  9.2011
Patched Lua 5.1.4, OPT = 2 :  5.8984

Before you ask: I don't have any information about how the patch alters the
execution speed, and I don't plan to do any soon, as this is not at all
something I'm concerned with at this point. Clearly the virtual machine
would be slower, but I have no idea how much slower. Of course, you're more
than welcomed to test this yourself and post your results.

Testing
=======

I tested my patch with the Lua 5.1 test suite (
<A HREF="http://lua-users.org/lists/lua-l/2006-03/msg00723.html">http://lua-users.org/lists/lua-l/2006-03/msg00723.html</A>). I had to modify it
a bit to take into account the new datatypes, the modified test suite is
available from <A HREF="ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/elua">ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/elua</A> (anonymous). The test suite was
an excellent testing tool. I thought I had the patch ready until I found the
test suite and ran it. After another week of work, I had something that
could be called functional :)

I tested everything via &quot;make generic&quot;, which is how I always build Lua for
my embedded environments. This means (among other things) that I didn't test
pipes and dynamic module loading, although I don't see why they wouldn't
work (except for pipes, which won't work at optmization level 2, as already
explained).

I never tested the patch in a multithreaded environment with more threads
running different lua_States. I never even used regular Lua like this, so I
can't make asumptions about how my patch would behave in a multithreaded
environment. It doesn't use any global or static variables, but you might
encounter other problems with it.

================================================================================

Coming up next: how to use the patch in eLua.

Best,
Bogdan

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If you've been wondering why I suddenly stopped replying in the threads
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about the platform specific modules/ADC platform interface/whatever else,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> here's your answer: in the last couple of days I've been working like a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> crazy maniac on integrating my Lua Tiny RAM (LTR) patch in eLua. I'll send a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> larger e-mail explaining what's LTR later, for now let's review the svn
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> commit log:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *- Lua Tiny RAM (LTR) patch is now integrated in eLua and is enabled by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> default
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - all eLua modules updated to work with LTR
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *And now for something really interesting: the results! The table below
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> summarizes the RAM usage in kbytes (as obtained by running *lua -e
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;print(collectgarbage'count')&quot; *from the eLua shell). OPT=0 is LTR's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;compatibility mode&quot; (basically this means that the patch is disabled, so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you're running plain Lua) and OPT=2 is the patch in action.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> |=============|============|============|
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> | PLATFORM    |   OPT=0    |   OPT=2    |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> |=============|============|============|

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> | I386        |     16.90  |      5.42  |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> | LM3S        |     27.14  |      5.42  |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> | STM32       |     ?????  |      ????  | (hint: 5.42:))
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> |=============|============|============|
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Beautiful, no? :)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *Mike, *please test this on your STM3210 board (yes, I also modified your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> port) and let me know how it works.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - *&quot;cpu&quot; module added to avr32, at91sam7x, str7*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Pretty self-explanatory.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * - &quot;disp&quot; module no longer generic (now stays in src/modules/lm3s). For
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this reason, the &quot;disp&quot; platform interface was also removed.*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This concludes an older discussion on the list. The &quot;disp&quot; module was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> specific to the LM3S boards, and its platform interface wasn't generic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> enough, so it was moved to the LM3S backend and the platform interface was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> removed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *- the &quot;modcommon&quot; mechanism in STM32 (ROM loader) was depreciated in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> favour of the Lua Tiny RAM patch (and the &quot;stm3210lcd&quot; module from the STM32
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> backend now uses LTR).*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sorry, Mike :), but I really think this is the better way to go with this.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe we can still use parts of your mechanism in other parts of eLua.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * - small bugfixes*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'll be coming back to our API-related threads after I manage to breathe a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bit :) and after I send more information about LTR to the world.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
