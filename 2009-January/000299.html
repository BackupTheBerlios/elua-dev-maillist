<PRE>I suppose one other option here is to use virtual timers instead of dedicated ones? I've looked at the virtual timer stuff that has been checked in, but I have to admit that I've not yet quite figured out how to make use of them. It looks like they're using SysTick? 

I've seen another &quot;virtual&quot; timer implementation out there that was posted on the LM boards (not sure how generalizable the code might be for other platforms, nor what license the code is under), which supposedly allows for setting up an &quot;unlimited&quot; number of timers, events and delays. 

Certainly interesting :-)

Subject: [eLua-dev] On Timers &amp; ADC 

So I've been thinking about how to accomplish burst sampling at a given rate (or background sampling). The Stellaris ADCs are programmable in terms of selecting a sampling rate, but the range is pretty limited, and fairly fast (125 ksamples/s - 1 msample/s). In order to do more arbitrary rates, I'll need to use a timer. The issue I see is: what if I'm already using a timer, or multiple timers for some purpose? In cases where something like this is needed should timers be reserved/locked? 


I've not worked with all the other supported platforms, but from working with some other microcontrollers I think a timer will be needed. In going with how things are already implemented (platform_uart_recv), I'm going to assume this is how I'll have to adjust things. As such, I suppose the ADC API should be amended a bit, as follows: 



void platform_adc_burst( unsigned id, u16* buf, unsigned count, unsigned timer_id, u32 frequency ); 








The current API then looks like this: 



int platform_adc_exists( unsigned id ); 
u16 platform_adc_sample( unsigned id ); 
u16 platform_adc_maxval( unsigned id ); 
void platform_adc_start( unsigned id ); 
int platform_adc_is_done( unsigned id ); 
void platform_adc_set_mode( unsigned id, int mode ); 
void platform_adc_burst( unsigned id, u16* buf, unsigned count, unsigned timer_id, u32 frequency ); 


If continuous mode sampling is to run at a rate that isn't in the range of 125 ksamples to 1 msamples, we might either need to have the set_mode function accept a timer (which is less useful in the case of doing single-shot, but timers can be used that way :-)), or have another function like burst, but that isn't blocking, and has a corresponding stop function. 


I'm also going to add a smoothing option, which in the context of single shot or continuous simply means that enough samples must be averaged before the result is_done. For burst, we could do this too, either as oversampling (i.e. each burst sample is actually 5 averaged values, that are available because we're actually sampling at 5 times the rate passed to adc_burst) or with a moving average filter. For single shot, these would be the same, but they differ when we're talking about continuous or burst sampling. One requires that filter_length samples be collected prior to each averaged sample being released, and the other runs at the sampling rate, as soon as filter_length samples are collected so that the moving average has enough data. Hmm... 


The stellaris platform has hardware averaging, though it is designed for being used for oversampling, not just rolling averages. 


This article does a decent job of outlining the issues:

I think for now I will implement smoothing as follows, using a moving average filter: 
void platform_adc_set_smoothing( unsigned id, u8 length );
