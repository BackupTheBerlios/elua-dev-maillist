</I>&gt;<i> neat stuff, like the virtual timers that I implemented recently) than to try
</I>&gt;<i> to figure this out from the hardware. After all, Lua is a high level
</I>&gt;<i> language, and although the programmer does indeed use it at a level that's
</I>&gt;<i> very close to the hardware, he might not want to feel this. Much like most C
</I>&gt;<i> programmer out there don't want to feel that there's some assembly code
</I>&gt;<i> lurking in the shadows of their beautifully intended code blocks :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Hmm, I think I understand where your coming from now.  I guess I am just the
kind of guy that likes to get down to the nitty gritty some times. :)

Maybe it would be possible to have it both ways? The reason its needed is
because if someone wanted to use the timer as a PWM generator knowing the
counter width is necessary... Unless everything is done in time units, in
which case while it might be odd for the PWM case, I think every other case
it would be more natural for, IE: pulse width measurements,  pulse
generation, frequency generation, etc...

Maybe you are turning me in your direction on this one ;)


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes actually I have done quite a bit, but in C and not Lua, where an array
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would take up less space.  Remember I specified that the array members are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> static constant objects (could be your rotable, or just light userdata
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> preallocated in rom), so the only space used would be for the array itself,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which could be forceably destroyed after its done being used by calling the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> garbage collector.  The table is basically just a function table so it need
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> no dynamic storage itself.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ah, OK, I got it now. You're right, with my patch this doesn't add at all
</I>&gt;<i> to the RAM consumption.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> STM32 will allow this, and I believe some Coldfire processors can as well.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But you probably still agree that most micros don't allow you to do this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yeah, well definately most of the smaller ones.  Maybe pairing could be
dropped and made 'automatic' then.  Its definately not a required feature
for the interface.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Calling pair on a channel that does not support pairing is invalid. ;) I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would assume that users of the interface would use the capabilities
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> functionality to query channels before performing operations on them.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is the thing that I dislike the most in your approach: the continous
</I>&gt;<i> query/execute operation. It kinda reminds me of COM :), but this is not the
</I>&gt;<i> main reason I dislike it, it's because I find it very tiring to write code
</I>&gt;<i> in this way (asking if you can do something before you actually do it; I
</I>&gt;<i> like more the &quot;bad boy&quot; approach: do it directly. Also less safe, it's also
</I>&gt;<i> much easier to code IMO). And again, I think this contradicts with the idea
</I>&gt;<i> of &quot;the user must know his hardware&quot;, in the sense that the query
</I>&gt;<i> capabilities step becomes unnecessary.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You can still do it the 'dangerous' way with this methodology, there is
nothing keeping you from plugging random things in to the code. ;)  If thats
the case we could remove the query interface completely, but still have the
request channels by type and mode interfaces. Oh, and you only have to ask
once, or not at all if you already know what it can do.

Also, having the query interface makes it possible to write a simple Lua
script that can run on *any* CPU that spewes all the available hardware and
what capabilities it has, for the more novice user. For that alone I think
it would be invaluable. Imagine being able to hand a student an embedded CPU
board and this Lua script, and in 5 minutes they know all the capabilities
of the CPU that Lua has access to.  They could even print the results (hell
we could generate a PDF with them and inclue it in the source) so they would
never have to do a query again.  If they forget for some reason what
capabilities a particular module has, all they have to do is run a simple
script to refresh their memory, never having to look at the documentation
again!  Since I am the kind of person that *hates* having to leave his code
editor, this is an awsome feature.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Possibly, but thats why the capabilities functionality exists. I really
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> love self documenting code. ;)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I understand, and I think this is an important difference in our coding
</I>&gt;<i> styles. I too like self-documenting code, but to the point where
</I>&gt;<i> self-documentation becomes a purpose in itself, thus altering the code too
</I>&gt;<i> much.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Nothing is altered, if you already know the capabilities of the hardware,
dont run the query.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Very true, but I assume that the users of eLua know something about the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hardware they are using (after all they have to at least know what pins the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> timers connect to!) and are familliar
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> enough with embedded systems programming to know that all platforms are not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> created equal. :)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, mister self-documenting guy :), don't you think that:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> lm3s.tmr.pair(0)
</I>&gt;<i> tmr.delay(0, us)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> is more self documenting than:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> timers[0].pair(0).delay(us) (or something similar)? :P
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Not really.  The only difference between the two for my eyes is that one is
meant to run on an lm3s CPU and the other can run on anything that supports
timer pairing.  The second is actually cleaner, because if you wanted to
write portable code you would not have to have things like if (cpu.type() ==
&quot;lm3s&quot;) do ... everywhere (assuming you knew that every platform you want to
run it on supports timer pairing).


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Very true, and this is why I liked the idea very much. You do have another
</I>&gt;<i> approach in this case(which is used by my virtual timers implementation): if
</I>&gt;<i> a timer is dedicated to a specific set of operations and you don't want it
</I>&gt;<i> disturbed, simply don't expose it to the Lua interface.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
But what if you want to use it in Lua, just not have other Lua tasks be able
to use it?


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, real harware is eternal, how many times have you used a CPU that had
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a timer that disappeared when you forgot it was there? ;)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd rather not answer this :D
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Of course, it was meant to be silly. :)


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Basically I envision a timer to be lock()ed whenever its being used, even
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if its not currently referenced in any code in the current scope, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unlock()ed if the timer is idle and free to be retasked to do something
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> else.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And this is why your idea seems so good. I'll think of a nice, generic way
</I>&gt;<i> to implement it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks for the discussion on this, I think if we keep this up we will end
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> up with quite a robust code base!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So it seems! Thank you too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Lets keep it up!  I would like others to join too though. :)  Also, this
need not be confined to a timer interface, I was just thinking of the most
complex peripheral I could use as an example. Technically these ideas should
apply to anything.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best,
</I>&gt;<i> Bogdan
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Thanks,
Mike
