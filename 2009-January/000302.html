</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Precisely :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As such, I suppose the ADC API should be amended a bit, as follows:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; void platform_adc_burst( unsigned id, u16* buf, unsigned count,  
</I>&gt;<i> unsigned timer_id, u32 frequency );
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The current API then looks like this:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; int platform_adc_exists( unsigned id );
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; u16 platform_adc_sample( unsigned id );
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; u16 platform_adc_maxval( unsigned id );
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; void platform_adc_start( unsigned id );
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; int platform_adc_is_done( unsigned id );

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; void platform_adc_burst( unsigned id, u16* buf, unsigned count,  
</I>&gt;<i> unsigned timer_id, u32 frequency );
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The current approach is to have the &quot;common&quot; functions as separate

</I>&gt;<i> platform_timer_op, platform_pwm_op ...) just to reduce the number of  
</I>&gt;<i> actual functions one needs to implement for a given backend (this  
</I>&gt;<i> looks less scary for someone that wants to port to a new  
</I>&gt;<i> backend :) ). In this case I'd make the exists, sample, start and  
</I>&gt;<i> is_done function independent, and put everything else in a  
</I>&gt;<i> platform_adc_op. It's not a requirement though, if this looks better  
</I>&gt;<i> to you then go for it, I'll leave it up to you.
</I>
Yeah, I was starting to feel that I might want to do that once the  
number of functions was growing...   I'll switch over to that for the  
next set of feature update.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If continuous mode sampling is to run at a rate that isn't in the  
</I>&gt;<i> range of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 125 ksamples to 1 msamples, we might either need to have the  
</I>&gt;<i> set_mode
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; function accept a timer (which is less useful in the case of doing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; single-shot, but timers can be used that way :-)), or have another  
</I>&gt;<i> function
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like burst, but that isn't blocking, and has a corresponding stop  
</I>&gt;<i> function.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What about this: make &quot;set_mode&quot; specify one more thing: blocking or  
</I>&gt;<i> non-blocking. After that, both sample and burst would work in that  
</I>&gt;<i> mode. This would eliminate the need for &quot;start&quot;, and would also make  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;burst&quot; blocking when needed. And the timer would always be  
</I>&gt;<i> specified in &quot;burst&quot;, so we don't need as a parameter to &quot;mode&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> By the way, do we really need the &quot;continuous&quot; mode? Maybe we can  
</I>&gt;<i> specify &quot;0&quot; as a parameter to platform_adc_burst (which would mean  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;do this at the maximum speed&quot;) and forget about the continous mode  
</I>&gt;<i> altogether. And then &quot;set mode&quot; would just set the blocking or non- 
</I>&gt;<i> blocking mode. Seems more &quot;natural&quot; this way.
</I>
That sounds good.

Regarding continuous mode, I have two thoughts.  As far as the &quot;do  
this as fast as possible&quot; burst mode is considered, I think that  
sounds good.  The other thought here is that &quot;continuous&quot; mode can  
also be thought of as &quot;background sampling mode&quot; where ADC conversions  
run at whatever rate you chose and dump a new sample into a buffer  
whenever ready.  This could be nice in situations where a sampling  
rate might not be terribly high, or if I want to drive an application  
to update something whenever new data is available.  Say, I have a  
scope, and I want to display the last 50 samples, or something  
similar.  I can update my display whenever I notice that there is a  
new sample to be added.  I suppose something similar could be done on  
the Lua side with a timer and sample being used in single-shot,  
though. I'm not sure how the overhead compares, but what you suggest I  
think might be more straightforward for an end user.  I'll think about  
this, and maybe make some benchmarks.

&gt;<i> &gt; I'm also going to add a smoothing option, which in the context of  
</I>&gt;<i> single
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; shot or continuous simply means that  enough samples must be  
</I>&gt;<i> averaged before
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the result is_done.  For burst, we could do this too, either as  
</I>&gt;<i> oversampling
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (i.e. each burst sample is actually 5 averaged values, that are  
</I>&gt;<i> available
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because we're actually sampling at 5 times the rate passed to  
</I>&gt;<i> adc_burst) or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with a moving average filter.  For single shot, these would be the  
</I>&gt;<i> same, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they differ when we're talking about continuous or burst  
</I>&gt;<i> sampling.  One
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; requires that filter_length samples be collected prior to each  
</I>&gt;<i> averaged
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sample being released, and the other runs at the sampling rate, as  
</I>&gt;<i> soon as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; filter_length samples are collected so that the moving average has  
</I>&gt;<i> enough
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; data. Hmm...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It shouldn't be diferent. Everything is oversampled by x, and every  
</I>&gt;<i> x sample you return an actual result to the system. This makes more  
</I>&gt;<i> sense if we adopt the frequency=0 convention I mentioned above.
</I>
Hmm.. so are you suggesting that smoothing do just oversampling or a  
moving average, or that we have options for both?

I think for lower sampling rates (not near the maximum rate) with  
short windows (x8, x16), oversampling makes a lot of sense, especially  
where there's a hardware averager ;-)  When it comes to other  
platforms, whether you do a moving average or oversampling, you still  
have to do the same amount of averaging whether you use one or the  
other. Assuming that the device has a single sample buffer for data,  
and no mechanism to write samples directly to RAM interrupt traffic  
might be about the same too.

Depending on sample rate, with a moving average you might be able to  
have longer filters.  That said, these devices don't have much RAM, so  
this may not matter that much.

&gt;<i> &gt; The stellaris platform has hardware averaging, though it is  
</I>&gt;<i> designed for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; being used for oversampling, not just rolling averages.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But isn't the functionality similar? Or they just do a simple  
</I>&gt;<i> averaging in LM3S, instead of a moving average? (sorry, way too  
</I>&gt;<i> sleepy to check now).
</I>
I could be wrong, but they appear to do simple averaging, where one  
takes (output sample rate)*(oversampling order) samples, averages a  
unique set of samples for each one outputted.  I'll look if there's a  
way around this.  When they give an example of code for moving average  
in the app-note linked below, they do the averaging in software.

&gt;<i> &gt; This article does a decent job of outlining the issues:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://www.zlgmcu.com/luminary/download/LM3SAPP_ADC_OverSample_Tech_en.pdf">http://www.zlgmcu.com/luminary/download/LM3SAPP_ADC_OverSample_Tech_en.pdf</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll try to take a look at that. What I know for sure is that a 16x  
</I>&gt;<i> or even 8x moving average filter can work wonders, so we'd better  
</I>&gt;<i> have that, even if it involves interrupts.
</I>&gt;<i> A little homework for you :): try to figure out a way to have  
</I>&gt;<i> adc_burst mode work (optionally) in double buffering mode. It's  
</I>&gt;<i> really useful for lots of applications.
</I>
Yeah, I can see why double buffering would be useful.  I'll keep that  
in mind when I'm putting together this implementation.

Oversampling on Stellaris doesn't necessarily need extra interrupt  
handlers for low numbers of samples (on the 16x or 8x order) for  
single-shot.

For non-single shot sampling I'll need to have an ISR to copy stuff  
from the ADC register to some separate buffer in order to prevent the  
ADC registers/fifos from overflowing.  To some extent this is  
avoidable for small numbers of samples, but I think I'll do a general  
implementation, since I don't think all the other ARM ADCs use FIFOs  
for buffering samples, and even on Stellaris the FIFOs vary in length  
depending on which sequencer you use.  So, I would consider their use  
an optimization that will add a bit of backend complexity.

The other thing I've noted is that when I tried

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; void platform_adc_set_smoothing( unsigned id, u8 length );
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed. And length should probably be a power of 2 to make things  
</I>&gt;<i> (like modulo and division operations) faster.
</I>
I agree.  I was originally going to do this so that it would be  
recognized that the length was a power of two, but to still support  
doing the slower division.  I suppose we could have users pass the  
exponent (2^&lt;value passed&gt;), but I feel like that would be strange

I'll take a look again, it was late when I was thinking about them.   
This could be one way to remove the need to pass a timer to things  
like the burst function?  Are there any major downsides to the virtual  
timers besides memory usage?  I assume there might be more CPU usage.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can have unlimited timers here too. Provided, of course, you

</I>
Ah, I had seen the number of virtual timers predefined, and I wasn't  
sure if that was a hard resource limitation or not :-)

I'll check things in when I have a few more stable features.
