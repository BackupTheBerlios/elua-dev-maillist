<PRE>&gt;<i> In a related vein, one thing that I've not used on micros that much, but
</I>&gt;<i> have on dedicated ADC boards is the use of triggers for sampling.  This
</I>&gt;<i> would be particularly useful for burst sampling.  Sometimes this is done
</I>&gt;<i> based on the signal itself, but often with a digital trigger.  The digital
</I>&gt;<i> trigger should be pretty easy to do by having the kickoff be interrupt
</I>&gt;<i> driven.  If a board doesn't support external interrupts, you could always
</I>&gt;<i> emulate it by polling, although it's not as good.
</I>
True, but I don't know much about the possible triggering sources on
different platforms, so I don't know how to formulate this into a
proper API.

&gt;<i> I guess this brings up the question:  do we allow arbitrary pin selection
</I>&gt;<i> regardless of whether it will generate interrupts?  I have less knowledge of
</I>&gt;<i> how this is supported on various 32-bit platforms that eLua is running on.
</I>&gt;<i>  IIRC, the LM3S boards can do interrupts on any pin.
</I>
Yes, but are any of them possible triggers for the ADC?

&gt;<i> With this in mind, this is what I came up with:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> int platform_adc_exists( unsigned id ); // generic, it will be part of
</I>&gt;<i> src/common.c
</I>&gt;<i> u16 platform_adc_sample( unsigned id ); // sample the specified ADC channel
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK.  So this will return the latest sample collected?  Does it block waiting
</I>&gt;<i> for completion if the latest one hasn't finished yet?
</I>
Yes on both questions.

&gt;<i> Also, should this behavior be different in continuous vs single shot? i.e.:
</I>&gt;<i> Single Shot: wait for sample if not ready
</I>&gt;<i> Continuous: take whatever the last completed sample was?  wait for next
</I>&gt;<i> sample? (I think the former would make more sense as a reason to use
</I>&gt;<i> continuous sampling).
</I>
Not sure yet. I think the difference should be in the
&quot;platform_adc_sample&quot; function, which should know how to behave in
both 'single' and 'continous' modes.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> void platform_adc_start( unsigned id ); // starts a conversion on the
</I>&gt;<i> specified ADC channel and returns immediately
</I>&gt;<i> int platform_adc_is_done( unsigned id ); // returns 1 if the conversion on
</I>&gt;<i> the specified channel ended, 0 otherwise
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wonder if in the case of using an interpreted language like Lua that one
</I>&gt;<i> might be converting values fast enough that having some sort of loop waiting
</I>&gt;<i> for the data to be done might not be fruitful, at least in single shot mode?
</I>
It might be, but as this is highly dependent on the platform we won't
make this assumption, going to the more generic route instead.

&gt;<i> void platform_adc_set_mode( unsigned id, int mode ); // sets the mode on the
</I>&gt;<i> specified ADC channel to either &quot;single shot&quot; or &quot;continuous&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm.. what about adding a filtered/smoothed mode? By this I don't mean
</I>&gt;<i> anything particularly intense, perhaps just a ring buffer of a set length
</I>&gt;<i> that gets averaged whenever platform_adc_sample is called.  I find myself
</I>&gt;<i> frequently doing things like this when sampling things that are noisier than
</I>&gt;<i> the best resolution the ADC can deliver.  My only thought here would be that
</I>&gt;<i> the C code might do this faster than doing the averaging in Lua.
</I>&gt;<i> One way to handle this somewhat elegantly would be to not even add anything
</I>&gt;<i> to the mode function, just have the default buffer be of length 1, and under
</I>&gt;<i> this condition, no smoothing is done.  If you want it, use the following
</I>&gt;<i> function to enable the rolling average:
</I>&gt;<i> void platform_adc_set_smoothing( unsigned id, int length ); // sets window
</I>&gt;<i> length/buffer size for moving average filter
</I>&gt;<i> Does this seem too much to have in the library?
</I>
No, actually this is a very good idea. In all the apps I used so far I
needed to implement a moving average filter in order to actually use
the data I read from the ADC. Even more, some platforms (like LM3S)
have hardware filters, which is even cooler. So yes, let's add this
too.

&gt;<i> void platform_adc_burst( unsigned id, u16* buf, unsigned count, u32
</I>&gt;<i> frequency ); // burst conversion: read &quot;count&quot; samples from the ADC channel
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;id&quot;, storing the results in &quot;buf&quot;. The samples are read at periodic
</I>&gt;<i> intervals, the period is given by &quot;frequency&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I like this as well.
</I>&gt;<i> One thing that might be interesting to provide as well, would be some method
</I>&gt;<i> to do this type of recording directly to a binary file in the mini
</I>&gt;<i> filesystem or onto an SD card or something similar.  This could be useful if
</I>&gt;<i> one wants to capture more data than can be held in SRAM at once, but the
</I>&gt;<i> sampling rate would have to drop down to much to record and transfer data a
</I>&gt;<i> machine connected to the micro.
</I>
This is a logging application by itself :), and since it could be
implemented directly from Lua, let's not do this in the ADC platform
interface, it's beyond its purpose. One thing that we could do for
this kind of applications is to make the platform_adc_burst function
non-blocking, so one can use double buffering (or even better give it
another argument to specifiy if it's blocking or not). Something like
this:

local buf1, buf2
local active = buf1
adc.start_burst( active, ... , adc.NONBLOCKING )
while true do
  local newactive = active == buf1 and buf2 or buf1
  while adc.burst_in_progress( active, ...) do end
  adc.start_burst( newactive, ... adc.NONBLOCKING )
  io.write( active )
  active = newactive
end

I have other ideas about this. Another mode I'm considering is having
the ADC acquisition run continously &quot;in the background&quot; (using
interrupt handlers) at a given frequency (with averaging if required)
and running over a circular buffering mechanism that would provide
functions like &quot;get_num_samples&quot;, or (when interrupts handlers in Lua
are implemented) interrupt triggering at a specified buffer fill rate
(in much the same way most UARTs with FIFOs can trigger an interrupt
when the FIFO is filled up to a given ratio). It would be much easier
to implement double buffering with something like this. But we're not
there just yet :)

Best,
Bogdan
