<PRE>OK, will do. &#160;I'll always submit patches whenever I think something is in reasonable shape. 


For reference, if you'd like to play with it, the github clone is here:&#160; <A HREF="http://github.com/jsnyder/elua/tree/master">http://github.com/jsnyder/elua/tree/master</A> 




I'll try and keep it up to date as long as I'm playing with eLua, since I don't have an automated mechanism set up for fetching and pushing changes.

Yeah, I didn't read it back.&#160; I'm finding it somewhat confusing figuring out how to deal with the latest OpenOCD syntax.&#160; I'll try poking the people in the OpenOCD forum to see if I can get a solution. 

I know what you're saying, but unfortunately I can't help you much here, so good luck with the OpenOCD forum. And I mean that literally. In my experience, people there are only friendly to other OpenOCD developers. YMMV, of course. 
&#160; 




It could be done either way.&#160; If I were making changes I would not be making them on the trunk.&#160; The first thing I did before doing anything was to make a local branch (which I used to generate the patch I sent). I do like git, quite a bit, as it provides more flexibility than SVN.&#160; One thing that is nice about it is that it interoperates with svn repos pretty well.&#160; It also is designed in such a way that branching and merging are much less painful than SVN. 

Cool, I'll take a closer look at it when I have some time. 






I guess what I was suggesting with GitHub would be to mirror the repo, and in addition to have a branch I could work in which I wouldn't merge into trunk, in order to maintain compatibility with the main eLua repository.&#160; Would that be more acceptable?&#160; If not, I can just work out of a private copy that I'll just keep on my own machines since just interacting with the main svn repo isn't bad with git. 

You can have as many repositories as you like :) The bad things would be to check in changes to your local repositories, changes that never make it to the official eLua trunk. As long as this doesn't happen, everything is OK. 
&#160; 




Here's Google Tech Talk that provides an intro to git:

Thanks!
