<PRE>Very interesting discussion!

I think James summarized the debate quite nicely. You just cannot have your
cake and eat it in this situation.
I personally see that there are important values on both sides of the
debate: standardizing things makes it easy and seamless to jump from one
specific HW platform to another, while having Mike's check/execute mechanism
would allow extracting best potential from the specifics of particular HW
platform.
In fact, i am convinced that both of these are needed.

Here are some thoughts about this after reading the debate:
   why not have 2 levels of abstraction the following way:
   - Mike's idea of check/execute mechanism will be the lower level and
implemented directly in C
   - Bogdan's more generic and &quot;worry-less&quot; interface will be the upper
level and *implemented in Lua*, and built *on top* of the Mike's layer
interfacing to it with the check/execute mechanism. This extra level of
abstraction will be HW specific just like Mike's layer, this is necessary as
the items in Bogdan's generic layer will depend on default configuration
details of the specific HW platform (i.e best default timer would be a 32bit
one on a platform that has 32bit timers, and 16bit on a platform that only
has 16bit timers, etc)

Example: Bogdan's layer implements a generic timer abstraction. This layer
queries Mike's layer for types of timers available (of which Mike's layer is
aware of) using a standardized querying mechanism, and also knows how to
determine the best type for the default timer that would be used in Bogdan's
layer as the default timer. Mike's layer knows how to supply hooks to
various types of timers' actions that Bogdan's layer understands how to use.

What this solves: A user who wants to use a generic timer, goes ahead with
the standard (Bogdan's) timer abstraction and doesn't concern oneself with
details like various checks (as Bogdan's layer takes care of all these
details in ways specific to particular HW platform)
A more advanced user, who wants to be &quot;closer to the metal&quot;, will use Mike's
layer directly

Potential gotchas and disadvantages:
- two layers instead of one, albeit only one layer is implemented in C, the
other one is all Lua.
- Mike's check/execute mechanism has to be standardized
- two sets of standards to maintain.


Hope this helps somewhat
Alex

</I>&gt;<i> You're right, timers can do much more than just generate delays, I was

</I>&gt;<i> tmr.getmindelay/tmr.getmaxdelay. Which are much more useful in this
</I>&gt;<i> particular situation, since knowing if a timer is 8/16/32 bits tells only
</I>&gt;<i> half of the story, you'd also need the timer frequency and a calculator
</I>&gt;<i> somewhere :) This is why I still stand by my initial point, which I'd like
</I>&gt;<i> to reformulate a bit: yes, the user should know his platform, he just
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't care that much about it. To me it's more natural to call functions
</I>&gt;<i> like &quot;getmindelay&quot; that completely hide the hardware (and allow for other
</I>&gt;<i> neat stuff, like the virtual timers that I implemented recently) than to try
</I>&gt;<i> to figure this out from the hardware. After all, Lua is a high level
</I>&gt;<i> language, and although the programmer does indeed use it at a level that's
</I>&gt;<i> very close to the hardware, he might not want to feel this. Much like most C
</I>&gt;<i> programmer out there don't want to feel that there's some assembly code
</I>&gt;<i> lurking in the shadows of their beautifully intended code blocks :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This brings up some basic issues with abstraction.  Recently I've had the
</I>&gt;<i> (not so great, because of the platform) privilege of helping some students
</I>&gt;<i> work with Basic Stamp for projects they were working on that involved some
</I>&gt;<i> servos.  A quick and easy way to control these is using the PULSOUT command.
</I>&gt;<i>  During the project a few of them had their boards burn out and they were
</I>&gt;<i> replaced with ones at higher clock rates, and what I found out was that the
</I>&gt;<i> values being used with PULSOUT were directly tied to clock rate, so they had
</I>&gt;<i> to guess at the ranges needed to control the servos.  To me this represents
</I>&gt;<i> a bad tradeoff of &quot;knowing your hardware,&quot; especially with something geared
</I>&gt;<i> towards accessibility for beginners.  On the other hand, with Arduino, this
</I>&gt;<i> is handled completely differently, the hardware details are completely
</I>&gt;<i> abstracted away.  One passes angles for the servo instead of pulse length
</I>&gt;<i> related to clock cycles or even millisecond length.  What's bizarre about
</I>&gt;<i> this is that Arduino basically uses C, and compiles down to AVR assembler,
</I>&gt;<i> and Basic Stamp is interpreted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Abstraction, almost much by definition, is limiting in some way. The
</I>&gt;<i> benefits one gets are in making something easier, that otherwise would not
</I>&gt;<i> have been.  In some cases you might want direct access to how the timers are
</I>&gt;<i> implemented and set things yourself.  One major downside to this is that
</I>&gt;<i> it's annoying to port, and may make for rather messy implementations.  If
</I>&gt;<i> you switch to another micro because it's a bit faster or has hardware
</I>&gt;<i> support for something that was previously being emulated, you might have to
</I>&gt;<i> tweak all of your magic numbers over again.  In order to get around this you
</I>&gt;<i> might also end up building some sort of abstraction in Lua instead of C.  If
</I>&gt;<i> the feature is useful in many cases, perhaps the module should be extended,
</I>&gt;<i> while keeping the abstraction consistent, to include the feature.  If the
</I>&gt;<i> feature is a one off, you could still write your own custom module in C.  I
</I>&gt;<i> think it would be nicer to keep the Lua side of the interface generally the
</I>&gt;<i> same across platforms where possible, with the exception of the platform
</I>&gt;<i> specific modules.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One other thought though:  If a feature, on some platforms, requires
</I>&gt;<i> emulation, and that emulation is particularly expensive over a full hardware
</I>&gt;<i> implementation, it might be nice to know if eLua is using that in emulation
</I>&gt;<i> rather than in hardware.  Perhaps this could somehow be tied in with the pd
</I>&gt;<i> module, either in the form of a list of hardware supported features, like
</I>&gt;<i> when one looks at /proc/cpuinfo on linux, or something else?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just a few thoughts.
