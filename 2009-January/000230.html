<PRE>Hi -

I've got the toolchain up and running on a Mac, most of the  
instructions worked fine for me with the one exception that (unlike on  
a Linux machine I'd tried before) for the steps where an autoconf was  
called for, doing so actually didn't go quite right and resulted in  
the configure scripts not recognizing many of the options being  
enabled.  Luckily, things seem to build OK with the out-of-the-box  
configure scripts with the latest versions of the libraries required.

My real reason for making this post, however, is related to the build  
process and in particular how things are handled by the preprocessor.   
I was trying to make a patch for the lm3s platform files so that  
another type of display (the OSRAM type OLED display, which I later  
realized isn't actually on my Rev C LM3S6965) could be used.  When I  
was trying to use some if blocks so that display support could switch  
between the RIT and OSRAM types, I noticed that the if statements  
didn't seem to work as expected. with ELUA_CPU and ELUA_BOARD for  
example.  An easy way to demonstrate this is to run the preprocessor  
on platform.c in the lm3s platform folder.  In advance, I'll point out  
that the following lines are found within:

#if ELUA_CPU == LM3S8962
   #define UARTS_COUNT 2
#elif ELUA_CPU == LM3S6965
   #define UARTS_COUNT 3
#endif

and as well, look at the function uarts_init(), which contains the line:

for( i = 0; i &lt; UARTS_COUNT; i ++ )

If I run the preprocessor with -DELUA_CPU= LM3S6965  I would expect  
the UARTS_COUNT in the line from uarts_init() to be replaced with the  
number 3, but this is not what I get.

If I run the following: arm-elf-cpp -DELUA_CPU=LM3S6965 platform.c |  
less

and then locate the same for loop, instead I see:

for( i = 0; i &lt; 2; i ++ )

Is this handled correctly with a different compiler preprocessor?  I'm  
using GCC 4.3.2, which I compiled per the instructions on the eLua  
site.  Having looked at the documentation for the gcc preprocessor, I  
don't think this would be expected to work either.  using the gcc -D  
flags with numbers definitely works, but these tokens for the  
different platforms doesn't, at least for me.

I would make a patch for some sort of fix, but I figured I'd touch  
base first.

Love the project, and it runs great on my LM3S6965 :-)

Best.


P.S. I was also really really happy to see an ls command added since  
the 0.5 release.
