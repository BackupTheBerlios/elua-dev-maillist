</I>&gt;&gt;<i> additional functionality specific to that platform.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Having a generic C interface has advantages not related to Lua. For
</I>&gt;<i> example, writing &quot;generic drivers&quot; for devices like serial ADCs/DACs, or
</I>&gt;<i> SD/MMC cards in SPI mode. Each of these can fully benefit from the platform
</I>&gt;<i> interface.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Very true.  I actually thought of that after I sent the message.  I was
thinking from a pure Lua perspective.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In this manner we could possibly give access to the various platform
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> modules in terms of functionality, like tmr.has_a(16BIT_TIMER), and,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tmr.tmr(TIMER1).capable_of(PULSE_CAPTURE). Since all timers at the top level
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> basically provide the same kinds of functionality (but may not export it the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> same way) this very well could work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Your interface seems to be &quot;more OOP&quot;, but IMO the code example above
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't make it look more useful. For example, I'm actually trying to _hide_
</I>&gt;<i> the fact that the platform has 8, 16 or 32 bit timers. As an eLua
</I>&gt;<i> programmer, I shouldn't care about that too much, as I just want to use the
</I>&gt;<i> timers for delays, or measuring elapsed time. Therefore, all I'd need (in an
</I>&gt;<i> ideal world :) ) would be &quot;tmr.delay&quot; and &quot;tmr.gettimediff&quot;. Your approach
</I>&gt;<i> does have the advantage of hiding some platform details from the user, in
</I>&gt;<i> that he can actually ask the system to provide a timer that can do
</I>&gt;<i> PULSE_CAPTURE without having to look through the datasheet trying to figure
</I>&gt;<i> out which one does. This is something we should consider, but it would
</I>&gt;<i> require a very good feature set (by &quot;feature&quot; I mean something like
</I>&gt;<i> PULSE_CAPTURE) specified for all peripherals. Not an easy task.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Oh, but timers can do so much more then just generate delays.  This is why I
proposed such a flexible interface.  As for caring what functionality a
platform has, IMO, since this is an embedded system and users would be
writing software that is closer to the hardware, I would argue that an eLua
user *would* want to know if the timer was 8, 16, or 32 bits.  Even if they
are just doing delays, that knowledge would be invaluable in that it could
tell you minimum timer resolution and maximum timeout values.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> An example usage might be something like:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 16bit_timers = tmr.has_a(16BIT_TIMER) -- returns an array of static
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> constant 'timer' objects
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The above code would return 8 timer objects on the LM3S CPUs with 4 timer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> modules, or 8 timer objects on an STM32F103ZE chip.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please don't take this the wrong way, as it's not in anyway a critique, I'm
</I>&gt;<i> just curious: am I right in presumimg that you're more accustomed to desktop
</I>&gt;<i> programming than to embedded programming? I'm asking because you just
</I>&gt;<i> allocated an array of objects that would steal a bit more of that oh so
</I>&gt;<i> precious RAM :) You gave me an idea though: having a method called
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;getcount&quot; or something similar for each module that would return the number
</I>&gt;<i> of available resources of that kind could be useful.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes actually I have done quite a bit, but in C and not Lua, where an array
would take up less space.  Remember I specified that the array members are
static constant objects (could be your rotable, or just light userdata
preallocated in rom), so the only space used would be for the array itself,
which could be forceably destroyed after its done being used by calling the
garbage collector.  The table is basically just a function table so it need
no dynamic storage itself.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 16bit_timers[1]:pair(twin) -- pairs a 16bit timer with its twin. The 2
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> timers (and the associated 32bit pair) must be in the 'unlocked' state.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Returns the static const 32bit timer object associated with the pair, or nil
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if an error occured.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another interesting problem here. 16bit_timers:pair is a very specific
</I>&gt;<i> method (from all the platforms I tried, LM3S is the only one able to
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;concatenate&quot; two 16-bit timer channels into a single 32-bit channel). So in
</I>&gt;<i> your view, the timer object would get together all the capabilities from all
</I>&gt;<i> the platforms inside it, thus letting any platform add any capability (which
</I>&gt;<i> was the original ideea, I know :) ). This has some drawbacks in my oppinion:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
STM32 will allow this, and I believe some Coldfire processors can as well.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - potential confusion. If some on (say) AT91SAM tries to do &quot;pair&quot; and gets
</I>&gt;<i> a nil, it might not understand why at first.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Calling pair on a channel that does not support pairing is invalid. ;) I
would assume that users of the interface would use the capabilities
functionality to query channels before performing operations on them.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - documentation issues: having to specify for each function on what
</I>&gt;<i> platform it works/doesn't work can be both hard to write and hard to read.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Possibly, but thats why the capabilities functionality exists. I really love
self documenting code. ;)


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - false sense of portability: if someone sees a code that says
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;16bit_timers[1]:pair(twin)&quot; he might think something between the lines of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;cool, eLua can do pair, so I can get any board I want and enjoy this&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> (let's face it: given a situation like this most people aren't going to RTFM
</I>&gt;<i> until it's too late :) ). But when you say:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> lm3s.tmr.pair(0)
</I>&gt;<i> tmr.delay(0,delay)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> it's a very strong hint that this code might not work on anything else than
</I>&gt;<i> LM3S.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Very true, but I assume that the users of eLua know something about the
hardware they are using (after all they have to at least know what pins the
timers connect to!) and are familliar enough with embedded systems
programming to know that all platforms are not created equal. :)


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 16bit_timers[1]:lock() -- Marks a timer as used, so other processes (or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> coding errors) do not interrupt a timers config.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 16bit_timers[1]:unlock() -- Marks a timer as free to be reconfigured for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> other purposes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This, on the other hand, is a very interesting idea. Locking/unlocking
</I>&gt;<i> resources is gold, since you'll always know what resource you can or cannot
</I>&gt;<i> use. Especially important in larger applications, where it's easier to loose
</I>&gt;<i> track of resources. Of course, it also introduces a problem: if you call
</I>&gt;<i> lock(), you must remember to call unlock(). C++ coders know that this is a
</I>&gt;<i> problem, since they frequently forget to deallocate resources in their class
</I>&gt;<i> destructors (I should know :) ). Or course, in Lua you could let the garbage
</I>&gt;<i> collector help you, and even if you don't it's much easier to track down the
</I>&gt;<i> problem, so this is something to keep in minde.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
In my mind the timers object(s) will be eternal and never be collected,
there for the unlock method must be explicitly called.  The reason for this
is the &quot;set it and forget it&quot; mode of operation used for some operations.
If your using a timer to generate a 10KHz square wave you only need to
configure the timer once, and then leave it alone for the duration of the
program. At the same time you don't want some other piece of code
reconfiguring the timer, nor do you want the timer to be reset when it goes
out of program scope.

The other reason to have the timers be eternal objects is you can set them
up in your startup code and then drop the reference, later on in another Lua
thread, ISR (not yet maybe?), or coroutine you can then reget that timer
object from the system and manipulate it without ever having to pass the
object around.

Also, real harware is eternal, how many times have you used a CPU that had a
timer that disappeared when you forgot it was there? ;)

Basically I envision a timer to be lock()ed whenever its being used, even if
its not currently referenced in any code in the current scope, and
unlock()ed if the timer is idle and free to be retasked to do something
else.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best,
</I>&gt;<i> Bogdan
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Thanks for the discussion on this, I think if we keep this up we will end up
with quite a robust code base!

Thanks,
Mike

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hi again,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> As most of you know by now, our platform interface is generic enough to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> be implemented by any eLua target. The unfortunate side effect of this is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that all the (potentially cool) specific features of each platform/board are

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> possibility of taking full advantage of their CPUs, we need to find a way to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> address this need.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This is my proposal:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> - every platform will have a module which name is the same as the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> platform name (&quot;lm3s&quot; for LM3S, &quot;stm32&quot; for STM32, you got the picture :) )
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> - this module will have two types of &quot;submodules&quot; (for want a better
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> term; what I mean is that each module will be able to embed other modules
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> inside it):
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   1. submodules with the same name as the &quot;standard&quot; modules. For
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> example: lm3s.uart, lm3s.tmr, lm3s.pio and so on. These will add to the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> functionality of the &quot;standard&quot; modules by providing platform-specific
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> functions.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   2. submodules that implement features found only on that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> platform/board. Dado's &quot;disp&quot; module is a very good example of this. By
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> having a module &quot;lm3s.disp&quot; we know for sure that we're reffering to a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> display that can be found on the LM3S board. This is a temporary solution,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> as a generic display architecture would be a much better choice, but it's
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> still good enough for our needs IMO.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> What say you?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
