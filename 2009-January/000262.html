<PRE>That sounds pretty good.  I had a slightly different approach in mind, but I
am not sure how you would feel about it.  Basically the idea is we would
turn the platform interface &quot;upside down&quot; from what it is now.  In other
words, we would export only a (minimal compatible) Lua level interface,
instead of the current way of exporting a generic (minimal) C interface.
Each platform would be required to adhere to the minimal Lua interface (IE
define the Lua module at the platform level), but at its discretion add
additional functionality specific to that platform.

In this manner we could possibly give access to the various platform modules
in terms of functionality, like tmr.has_a(16BIT_TIMER), and,
tmr.tmr(TIMER1).capable_of(PULSE_CAPTURE). Since all timers at the top level
basically provide the same kinds of functionality (but may not export it the
same way) this very well could work.

An example usage might be something like:

16bit_timers = tmr.has_a(16BIT_TIMER) -- returns an array of static constant
'timer' objects

The above code would return 8 timer objects on the LM3S CPUs with 4 timer
modules, or 8 timer objects on an STM32F103ZE chip.

Another way to find a timer to use could be done as follows:

pwm_timers = tmr.has_a(PWM_TIMER) -- returns an array of static constant
'timer' objects

The above code on an LM3S with 4 timer modules would return 8 timer objects,
or if it were run on an STM32F103ZE, it would only return 6, since only 6 of
the timers are PWM capable.

One you have access to a timer object, you could do several queries to it
before configuring it. An example:

16bit_timers[7]:capable_of(PWM_TIMER) -- returns true if the timer is
capable of PWM operation.
16bit_timers[7]:capabilities() -- returns a bitmask of all the capabilities
for the timer.
16bit_timers[7]:has_twin() -- returns the timer object of this timers twin,
nil otherwise (for chainable timers)
16bit_timers[1]:name() -- returns the name of the timer for this platform,
if available.
16bit_timers[1]:index() -- returns the platform specific index of this
timer.

16bit_timers[1]:pair(twin) -- pairs a 16bit timer with its twin. The 2
timers (and the associated 32bit pair) must be in the 'unlocked' state.
Returns the static const 32bit timer object associated with the pair, or nil
if an error occured.

16bit_timers[1]:lock() -- Marks a timer as used, so other processes (or
coding errors) do not interrupt a timers config.
16bit_timers[1]:unlock() -- Marks a timer as free to be reconfigured for
other purposes.

16bit_timers[1]:mode(...) -- Initializes a timer for a specific mode of
operation. Timer must be in the unlocked state prior to calling this
function. Available modes dependant on capabilities exported by the timer.
See timer.capabilities(). If a requested mode is not available, an error is
thrown.

16bit_timers[1].counter -- sets or gets the 16bit timer counter register
value.
16bit_timers[1].reload -- sets or gets the 16bit timer reload register
value.


Obviously there are other functions/etc that would need to exist for a full
implementation, but thats for further discussion. :)

What do you guys think?

&gt;<i> Hi again,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As most of you know by now, our platform interface is generic enough to be
</I>&gt;<i> implemented by any eLua target. The unfortunate side effect of this is that
</I>&gt;<i> all the (potentially cool) specific features of each platform/board are left
</I>&gt;<i> forgotten, and there's no way to access them directly. As some (probably
</I>&gt;<i> most) people would gladly sacrifice portability over the possibility of
</I>&gt;<i> taking full advantage of their CPUs, we need to find a way to address this
</I>&gt;<i> need.
</I>&gt;<i> This is my proposal:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - every platform will have a module which name is the same as the platform
</I>&gt;<i> name (&quot;lm3s&quot; for LM3S, &quot;stm32&quot; for STM32, you got the picture :) )
</I>&gt;<i> - this module will have two types of &quot;submodules&quot; (for want a better term;
</I>&gt;<i> what I mean is that each module will be able to embed other modules inside
</I>&gt;<i> it):
</I>&gt;<i>   1. submodules with the same name as the &quot;standard&quot; modules. For example:
</I>&gt;<i> lm3s.uart, lm3s.tmr, lm3s.pio and so on. These will add to the functionality
</I>&gt;<i> of the &quot;standard&quot; modules by providing platform-specific functions.
</I>&gt;<i>   2. submodules that implement features found only on that platform/board.
</I>&gt;<i> Dado's &quot;disp&quot; module is a very good example of this. By having a module
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;lm3s.disp&quot; we know for sure that we're reffering to a display that can be
</I>&gt;<i> found on the LM3S board. This is a temporary solution, as a generic display
</I>&gt;<i> architecture would be a much better choice, but it's still good enough for
</I>&gt;<i> our needs IMO.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What say you?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best,
</I>&gt;<i> Bogdan
