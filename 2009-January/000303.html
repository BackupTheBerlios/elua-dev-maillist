<PRE>When I started looking around at interpreted languages on  
microcontrollers I ran across not only eLua, but also PyMite (<A HREF="http://pymite.python-hosting.com/">http://pymite.python-hosting.com/</A> 
), the author of which (Dean) is now currently on this list.

I thought I would take this as an opportunity to strike up a little  
discussion on the merits and difficulties associated with implementing  
one language or the other (or any other interpreted languages, if it  
might be useful) on these devices with rather limited resources.

Lua seems naturally suited to limitations of an MCU, being pretty  
friendly to low resource situations out of the box.  I'm sure there  
are some modifications that were necessary to make eLua work in these  
environments in the first place, but sounds as if it didn't require  
much shoe-horning :-)

Python, on the other hand, being a &quot;batteries included&quot; language is  
quite large if you include all the standard modules and whatnot.  I  
certainly wouldn't expect that all of these would fit in an  
environment like the ones eLua or PyMite run on.  I would assume  
however, that some subset of libraries, and maybe core features of the  
language itself would fit reasonably (something like the array of  
modules that come with Lua?).

I'm wondering if those who have worked on implementing these  
environments could speak more intelligently about what is or is not  
reasonable, and maybe what some of the challenges are?  From my  
understanding PyMite implements a stripped down (maybe re-implemented  
from scratch?) version of Python's virtual machine.  I'm not sure if  
some of the opcodes are stripped out, or not, but I'm pretty sure that  
Python has way more opcodes than Lua does.  Also, lua makes use of a  
register-based VM rather than a more traditional stack-based VM.  Do  
these issues play a major role in how well these languages run and/or  
fit on a microcontroller?  Any thoughts on how these might relate to  
RAM, storage or CPU requirements?  On the python side, there is also  
TinyPy, which is supposedly modeled after lua in terms of the VM (not  
sure if it is register or stack based).  I've seen discussions on the  
TinyPy list about the current situation on getting it to run on micros  
(including needing to deal with filesystem ops for loading modules),  
but I'm not sure if it is reasonable or not to think that it might be  
a good solution.

I come from a background in a variety of languages, but have been  
using Python the most lately for desktop programming tasks.  I like it  
quite a bit as a language, and it has replaced MATLAB, C and other  
languages that I would have normally used otherwise to get something  
done.  I don't imagine writing much Lua for the types of things I use  
Python for on the desktop, but it sounds like it is better suited to  
MCUs without having to carve out any large portions of functionality.   
In particular, this means that the standard Lua documentation applies  
broadly to eLua, and that one can pretty much copy and paste a  
standard Lua script into eLua and have it work (so long as it doesn't  
use external modules not provided, or if the MCU doesn't have enough  
RAM).

Thanks!
