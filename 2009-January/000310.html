<PRE>Thanks for the detailed reply Dean.  This certainly makes a lot of  
things more clear, and I think we can have a good discussion around  
this.

</I>
Yeah, the 1-8Kb space is reasonable for many purposes when one is  
writing in ASM or C, so long as either the code or data aren't too  
large.  If the project is very specialized, it's great, but I can't  
imagine trying to squeeze a very large VM or compiler into that kind  
of ram and flash space, so I'm quite impressed that you've managed to  
get a significant portion of the VM to fit in such a small space.

I think this is also why Arduino does well on this platform.  While it  
is easy to outgrow the available flash on the ATMega168, adding  
functionality is modular, and since one is still basically writing C  
code, it's fairly efficient space-wise.  I think if you were to take  
all of the optional libraries for interfacing with devices that come  
with the default support software, and include them with minimal  
additional code, you would likely be outgrowing the available flash.   
When one wants to have a VM and/or compiler, plus all of the  
peripheral libraries, the overhead is even greater, and therefore more  
difficult.

Also, external RAM could be an option, but I would guess there isn't  
any dedicated pathway for that, requiring some sort of serial  
interface to some SRAM or something similar, which would be somewhat  
slow.

Do you happen to have references for the papers you mention?  I'm  
curious about what issues they were studying.  Were they looking at  
interpreted languages or virtual machines on MCUs, or something  
different?

Also, there is at least one other VM on ATMega project that exists out  
there, NanoVM, which I believe implements some portion of the Java VM: <A HREF="http://www.harbaum.org/till/nanovm/index.shtml">http://www.harbaum.org/till/nanovm/index.shtml</A>

&gt;<i> In my early background research, I found previous attempts to reduce
</I>&gt;<i> Python (Pippy, PythonCE) required around 256 KB of RAM and 1 M of
</I>&gt;<i> program memory... so a total rewrite was necessary.  I rewrote the
</I>&gt;<i> internal datastructures to reduce runtime memory requirements.  I
</I>&gt;<i> rewrote the core interpreter, picking one at a time which bytecodes
</I>&gt;<i> would make the cut to be included.  And I wrote the tools needed to
</I>&gt;<i> take a .pyc compiled on a PC and compress it to a smaller format for
</I>&gt;<i> inclusion into the program memory.  Literally, EVERY design decision
</I>&gt;<i> was to reduce size.  Python was a very hard language to make small...
</I>&gt;<i> and I'd say I still don't have it quite right.
</I>
OK, so is the VM by itself already consuming quite a bit of available  
resources?  i.e. if I write a simple LED blinking application, am I  
already consuming a majority of the available RAM?

&gt;<i> One thing I added to PyMite was a pretty slick and easy way to call C
</I>&gt;<i> functions from Python.  I call them native functions.  Briefly stated,
</I>&gt;<i> you write a Python module with function defs, but put the C code in
</I>&gt;<i> the docstring of the function and &quot;pass&quot; for the function body.  An
</I>&gt;<i> included, automated tool finds these native functions and builds them
</I>&gt;<i> into the executable and makes the lookup tables so it just works.
</I>&gt;<i> This method was a lot better for smaller targets than CPython's
</I>&gt;<i> method.  Using SWIG was never an option.  Lua has an easy way to write
</I>&gt;<i> C functions and call them.
</I>
I've been working with building extensions to Lua in C for putting  
together the ADC module, and I'm finding that it's fairly easy and  
lightweight.  CPython does make it fairly easy to do quite a few  
things interfacing with C libraries, but I can see where this would be  
overkill on a microcontroller.

&gt;<i> Lua was designed from the very start to be embedded (into other
</I>&gt;<i> programs as well as into smaller systems).  Python was designed for
</I>&gt;<i> the desktop and is rather big.  Even if I grow PyMite to use 256 KB
</I>&gt;<i> Flash and 64 KB SRAM, I don't think I'll be able to fit every Python
</I>&gt;<i> feature into PyMite.  Whereas, just recently, I showed that the eLua
</I>&gt;<i> interpreter (minus its parser/lexer) will fit in 64 KB Flash and 16 KB
</I>&gt;<i> SRAM.  So, in this respect, I believe Lua has the edge for size.
</I>&gt;<i> However, I believe that due to my focus on internal data structure
</I>&gt;<i> size, a PyMite program will use less RAM during runtime (but I admit
</I>&gt;<i> this is difficult to quantify).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PyMite is stack based, like CPython.  tinypy is register based, like
</I>&gt;<i> Lua.  I joined the tinypy maillist specifically because it's approach
</I>&gt;<i> (follow the Lua design, but use Python syntax) was what I thought I
</I>&gt;<i> wanted to do for the next version of PyMite.  However, tinypy's
</I>&gt;<i> developer is focused on the desktop target and speed for gaming.
</I>&gt;<i> tinypy would need a fairly significant rewrite for it to run in a low-
</I>&gt;<i> ram environment.
</I>
That's too bad about TinyPy.  It is an interesting project, but I also  
have to admit that I was a bit less than happy when I started playing  
with it and realized that there were a decent number of language  
features that weren't implemented yet.  I'm guessing that some of the  
&quot;significant rewrite&quot; would be slimming things down for a  
microcontroller environment.  I might further guess that bringing  
TinyPy closer to CPython (in language features) might conflict with  
the goals of running in a microcontroller.

&gt;<i> At this point, I believe eLua is in a great position: it offers the
</I>&gt;<i> Lua language and useful modules.  I believe with further development
</I>&gt;<i> PyMite could achieve a comparable level of ability as eLua on the same
</I>&gt;<i> devices, but still not offer all of CPython's features (decorators,
</I>&gt;<i> multiple inheritance, etc).
</I>
Right, especially if PyMite were targeting a 32-bit MCU with a bit  
more RAM and flash.  I also think that some Python language features  
might not be all that necessary on a microcontroller, and are better  
suited towards desktop-type programming anyways.  Personally I might  
not miss decorators or multiple inheritance, but would miss things  
like iterators.

Do you think that a compiler might fit in this slightly larger  
environment, enabling a self-hosted interpreter?

&gt;<i>  As a final note, I believe that since
</I>&gt;<i> PyMite is completely re-implemented from scratch, it stands to
</I>&gt;<i> introduce more design defects into the language.  So that is a
</I>&gt;<i> drawback.  I haven't diffed eLua's src/lua directory against the
</I>&gt;<i> standard Lua source tree, but I don't believe them to be vastly
</I>&gt;<i> different.  So eLua has a high fidelity to the  Lua language and a
</I>&gt;<i> common code base (fewer defects).
</I>
Right, especially given that Python doesn't really seem to have a spec  
for implementation, aside from CPython.  That said, I think the  
microcontroller environment makes this sort of issue better in some  
ways. The projects implemented on top of it are likely simpler, and  
might not have as many complex failure modes.

I suppose, however, that debugging a VM can be fairly complicated  
depending on the type of issue encountered.
