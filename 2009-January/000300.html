<PRE>&gt;<i> So I've been thinking about how to accomplish burst sampling at a given
</I>rate
&gt;<i> (or background sampling).  The Stellaris ADCs are programmable in terms of
</I>&gt;<i> selecting a sampling rate, but the range is pretty limited, and fairly
</I>fast
&gt;<i> (125 ksamples/s - 1 msample/s).  In order to do more arbitrary rates, I'll
</I>&gt;<i> need to use a timer.  The issue I see is: what if I'm already using a
</I>timer,
&gt;<i> or multiple timers for some purpose?  In cases where something like this
</I>is
&gt;<i> needed should timers be reserved/locked?
</I>
In the future, we'll most likely go with Mike's lock/unlock suggestion, so
this will be automatic. For now the user should manage the resources
himself.

&gt;<i> I've not worked with all the other supported platforms, but from working
</I>&gt;<i> with some other microcontrollers I think a timer will be needed.  In going
</I>&gt;<i> with how things are already implemented (platform_uart_recv), I'm going to
</I>&gt;<i> assume this is how I'll have to adjust things.
</I>
Precisely :)

&gt;<i> As such, I suppose the ADC API should be amended a bit, as follows:
</I>&gt;<i> void platform_adc_burst( unsigned id, u16* buf, unsigned
</I>count, unsigned timer_id, u32 frequency );

Right.

&gt;<i> The current API then looks like this:
</I>&gt;<i> int platform_adc_exists( unsigned id );
</I>&gt;<i> u16 platform_adc_sample( unsigned id );
</I>&gt;<i> u16 platform_adc_maxval( unsigned id );
</I>&gt;<i> void platform_adc_start( unsigned id );
</I>&gt;<i> int platform_adc_is_done( unsigned id );
</I>&gt;<i> void platform_adc_set_mode( unsigned id, int mode );
</I>&gt;<i> void platform_adc_burst( unsigned id, u16*
</I>buf, unsigned count, unsigned timer_id, u32 frequency );

The current approach is to have the &quot;common&quot; functions as separate function,
and the other grouped in a common function (see platform_timer_op,
platform_pwm_op ...) just to reduce the number of actual functions one needs
to implement for a given backend (this looks less scary for someone that
wants to port to a new backend :) ). In this case I'd make the exists,
sample, start and is_done function independent, and put everything else in a
platform_adc_op. It's not a requirement though, if this looks better to you
then go for it, I'll leave it up to you.

&gt;<i> If continuous mode sampling is to run at a rate that isn't in the range of
</I>&gt;<i> 125 ksamples to 1 msamples, we might either need to have the set_mode
</I>&gt;<i> function accept a timer (which is less useful in the case of doing
</I>&gt;<i> single-shot, but timers can be used that way :-)), or have another
</I>function
&gt;<i> like burst, but that isn't blocking, and has a corresponding stop
</I>function.

What about this: make &quot;set_mode&quot; specify one more thing: blocking or
non-blocking. After that, both sample and burst would work in that mode.
This would eliminate the need for &quot;start&quot;, and would also make &quot;burst&quot;
blocking when needed. And the timer would always be specified in &quot;burst&quot;, so
we don't need as a parameter to &quot;mode&quot;.
By the way, do we really need the &quot;continuous&quot; mode? Maybe we can specify
&quot;0&quot; as a parameter to platform_adc_burst (which would mean &quot;do this at the
maximum speed&quot;) and forget about the continous mode altogether. And then
&quot;set mode&quot; would just set the blocking or non-blocking mode. Seems more
&quot;natural&quot; this way.

&gt;<i> I'm also going to add a smoothing option, which in the context of single
</I>&gt;<i> shot or continuous simply means that  enough samples must be averaged
</I>before
&gt;<i> the result is_done.  For burst, we could do this too, either as
</I>oversampling
&gt;<i> (i.e. each burst sample is actually 5 averaged values, that are available
</I>&gt;<i> because we're actually sampling at 5 times the rate passed to adc_burst)
</I>or
&gt;<i> with a moving average filter.  For single shot, these would be the same,
</I>but
&gt;<i> they differ when we're talking about continuous or burst sampling.  One
</I>&gt;<i> requires that filter_length samples be collected prior to each averaged
</I>&gt;<i> sample being released, and the other runs at the sampling rate, as soon as
</I>&gt;<i> filter_length samples are collected so that the moving average has enough
</I>&gt;<i> data. Hmm...
</I>
It shouldn't be diferent. Everything is oversampled by x, and every x sample
you return an actual result to the system. This makes more sense if we adopt
the frequency=0 convention I mentioned above.

&gt;<i> The stellaris platform has hardware averaging, though it is designed for
</I>&gt;<i> being used for oversampling, not just rolling averages.
</I>
But isn't the functionality similar? Or they just do a simple averaging in
LM3S, instead of a moving average? (sorry, way too sleepy to check now).

&gt;<i> This article does a decent job of outlining the issues:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.zlgmcu.com/luminary/download/LM3SAPP_ADC_OverSample_Tech_en.pdf">http://www.zlgmcu.com/luminary/download/LM3SAPP_ADC_OverSample_Tech_en.pdf</A>
</I>
I'll try to take a look at that. What I know for sure is that a 16x or even
8x moving average filter can work wonders, so we'd better have that, even if
it involves interrupts.
A little homework for you :): try to figure out a way to have adc_burst mode
work (optionally) in double buffering mode. It's really useful for lots of
applications.

&gt;<i> void platform_adc_set_smoothing( unsigned id, u8 length );
</I>Agreed. And length should probably be a power of 2 to make things (like
modulo and division operations) faster.

Best,
Bogdan
