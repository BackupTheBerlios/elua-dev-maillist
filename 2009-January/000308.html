<PRE>Hi all,

A personal comment first: I _love_ it when people talk about different
programming languages and their relative advantages and disadvantages using
logical arguments and a civilized tone, without getting into religious wars
like &quot;my language will kick the living **** out of your language. Why? Cause
it DOES&quot;. Thanks for this, I really appreciate it.

And now my thoughts: I've been looking for a good way to embedded an
intepreted language into a microcontroller for a very long time now. For a
long while I've been the C-only type of programmer, that annoying guy who
thinks that everything but C (and maybe C++) is useless. Stupid, I know, but
so was me :) Once I started to widen my perspective a bit, the very first
thing I tried was Python, and it was a very pleasant experience for me. The
kind of productivity (and fun) I got from using Python was mind blowing for
someone that ate, dreamed and breathed C. I wrote a few large applications
in Python, and for desktop programming Python is still my favorite language
(and will probably remain so for a while). I explored others (Lua included),
but Python is the kind of complete package that most programmers are looking
for. I don't really care for the differences at the language level (while
Lua is simpler than Python, it's still a complete language), so I'm looking
at the libraries, and Python simply shines here.

However, I never considered Python for embedding into a MCU, because I
always though it was too 'heavy' for this task (this is why I find Dean's
work extraordinary). I started looking at Forth, and the conclusion was that
a &quot;regular&quot; user (maybe a non-programmer) wouldn't be crazy about the idea
of manipulating a stack directly, or writing his programs in postfix. The
same went for LISP. I find it interesting and challenging (although I only
had minimal exposure to it), but most people probably wouldn't. I also
considered different variants of BASIC (I was a big fan on BasicStamp when I
first met with micros), but BASIC just didn't do it for me the end, probably
because of my strong programming background that thought me a thing or two
about programming languages in general. This is why I knew I hit gold when I
found Lua. It was perfect for my needs in almost every way I could think of.


&gt;<i> I'm sure there are some modifications that were necessary to make eLua
</I>work in
&gt;<i> these environments in the first place, but sounds as if it didn't require
</I>&gt;<i> much shoe-horning :-)
</I>You'll laugh, but the only thing I really needed to do in order to run the
interpreter for the first time was to rename Lua' &quot;main&quot; function to
&quot;lua_main&quot; and call it from my program. I had to take care of Newlib
instead, providing it the proper stubs for the MCU. Lua uses only ANSI
functions (and some POSIX in the OS library, which is normal) so it was
extremely easy to port it. I did some tests (before starting the project)
with some different memory allocators (dlmalloc, TLSF, chained versions) to
see what are best for eLua. dlmalloc won the initial round :), so I was
ready to go.

&gt;<i>Right now PyMite (and a few developers) are begging me to develop PyMite to
</I>run
&gt;<i>on these devices with greater resources.
</I>Well then, you give me no choice but to join their group :) I'd LOVE to have
Python run on my ARMs.

&gt;<i> Lua was designed from the very start to be embedded (into other
</I>&gt;<i> programs as well as into smaller systems).  Python was designed for
</I>&gt;<i> the desktop and is rather big.  Even if I grow PyMite to use 256 KB
</I>&gt;<i> Flash and 64 KB SRAM, I don't think I'll be able to fit every Python
</I>&gt;<i> feature into PyMite.  Whereas, just recently, I showed that the eLua
</I>&gt;<i> interpreter (minus its parser/lexer) will fit in 64 KB Flash and 16 KB
</I>&gt;<i> SRAM.  So, in this respect, I believe Lua has the edge for size.
</I>&gt;<i> However, I believe that due to my focus on internal data structure
</I>&gt;<i> size, a PyMite program will use less RAM during runtime (but I admit
</I>&gt;<i> this is difficult to quantify).
</I>You might be right, I didn't try that. One thing to keep in mind here is
that eLua starts with all the standard Lua libraries included by default. It
could take less RAM if you don't use the io library and loadlib (require and
friends), they are the only standard libraries that I couldn't make fully
ROMable. I'm thinking about reimplement at least the io library so it can
become completely ROMable (at this point it uses userdata, which in turn
uses the Lua registry, thus it takes some RAM). And loadlib might not be
required at all in the application (although if this idea that keeps popping
in my head is right, I'll be able to provide eLua with loadable C modules
one day, just like on desktop). Many things to think about here ...
I'm actually still trying to get the Lua memory usage right. The parser is
recursive, so it will eat quite a bit of stack for non-trivial programs.
I've tried to adress this by moving all the large parser structures from the
stack to the heap and increasing the stack size to 2k (which is only an
experimental value), and it seems to work fine for now, but I definitely
need to get back to this with a more &quot;scientific&quot; approach.

&gt;<i> I haven't diffed eLua's src/lua directory against the
</I>&gt;<i> standard Lua source tree, but I don't believe them to be vastly
</I>&gt;<i> different.  So eLua has a high fidelity to the  Lua language and a
</I>&gt;<i> common code base (fewer defects).
</I>
These are the mods currently applied to Lua:

- lualong, a patch that changes Lua's number type from double to integer.
Quite safe, makes little to no modifications, unlikely to cause any
problems.
- my LTR. By far the most risky (and instrunsive) one, and likely to
introduce incompatibilities (but not serious ones; incompatibilities like
&quot;math is now a rotable, so you can't add new members to it&quot;. True, but you
probably wouldn't do that in a real life program anyway).
- some changes to the parser that move large structures from the stack to
the heap (as specified above). A very safe change IMO.
- some small tweaks in the standard luaconf.h files (maximum number of
upvalues, maximum size of an input buffer, things like this) neede to
decrease the memory consumption a bit.

Best,
Bogdan

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Coding a Python parser from scratch to target microcontrollers will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; certainly generate incompatibilities (or defects as you call them)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; versus
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the mainstream CPython implementation. Yet a Python subset could
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; still be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; very useful in many applications, especially if language
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; functionality is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; selected carefully. In most cases, people would not be porting a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; desktop
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; application to the embedded system but rather developing new code
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; specific embedded application. Besides, if a developer is proficient
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Python it is much easier for he/she to code their embedded
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; application with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a Python subset than to learn a new language. The core of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; language would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; need to be there; developers may be willing to work around a lack of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; multiple inheritance but they will resist changes to data
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; structures, flow
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; control, iterators and functions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is roughly the state PyMite is in right now.  It can do all the
</I>&gt;<i> basic things you'd expect: assignment, math and logic, control flow,
</I>&gt;<i> datatype operations, functions and modules (no iterators, though).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Lack of an interpreter mode would be a drawback. From your comments,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; appears PyMite required compiling the code on the desktop and didn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; implement an interpreter mode. Although most production code runs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; compiled,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; significant debugging and testing occurs in the interpreter. A
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; possible
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; workaround to avoid the parser/ compiler overhead would be to have a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; special
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;Python terminal&quot; on the desktop acting as a remote interpreter
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; console to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the embedded system, recompiling code as the user enters it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I call this an interactive mode.  PyMite has an interactive mode where
</I>&gt;<i> the desktop is the host and the target, but it hasn't been adapted to
</I>&gt;<i> a microcontroller target yet (not enough RAM on my ATmega103).
