<PRE>Bogdan, any thoughts on these points?

I'm a little busy at the moment (work pileup, plus a not quite cheap  
linear actuator broke on a project of mine.. AC servos can pack quite  
a punch), but I'm going to resume work on this in a day or two.

My reasoning on including the filtering/smoothing is that doing  
averaging and data handling in C might be lighter weight than having  
them converted to tables and then iterating in Lua, but I could be  
wrong :-)

One other thought is that, I suppose triggering could be handled with  
an ISR in Lua I suppose?  I guess I might worry about how  
deterministic something like this might be, as well as how many extra  
clock cycles might go by with such a trigger made in Lua vs some sort  
of direct hardware configuration or C ISR.  I guess one way to know  
would be to give it a go and see how many samples one might drop  
between trigger and sampling onset, with different configurations.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Following is my proposal for a platform interface for the ADC  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> peripheral. I have only very limited experience with ADCs/DACs, in  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fact the only two &quot;serious&quot; applications that I wrote and used ADCs  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> were based on external components and were quite basic on the data  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> acquisition part, so you might find this specification incomplete  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or just plain strange. If so, please let me know so we can refine  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it to a better form.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I tried to extract a common set of features of ADCs from all the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> CPUs that eLua currently supports, and this is what I came up with:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - most (or maybe all) of them support both &quot;single shot&quot; and  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;continous&quot; modes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - some of them let the user select ADC timings (like startup time  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and sample&amp;hold time). This seems to be quite rare though, so I  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> won't include it in the platform interface.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - some of them also support a special mode in which they are  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;paired&quot; with a hardware timer and use that timer as a conversion  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> clock. This is useful, and it can be emulated even on platforms  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that don't support this feature.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree with the use of the timer as a conversion clock.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In a related vein, one thing that I've not used on micros that much,  
</I>&gt;<i> but have on dedicated ADC boards is the use of triggers for  
</I>&gt;<i> sampling.  This would be particularly useful for burst sampling.   
</I>&gt;<i> Sometimes this is done based on the signal itself, but often with a  
</I>&gt;<i> digital trigger.  The digital trigger should be pretty easy to do by  
</I>&gt;<i> having the kickoff be interrupt driven.  If a board doesn't support  
</I>&gt;<i> external interrupts, you could always emulate it by polling,  
</I>&gt;<i> although it's not as good.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I guess this brings up the question:  do we allow arbitrary pin  
</I>&gt;<i> selection regardless of whether it will generate interrupts?  I have  
</I>&gt;<i> less knowledge of how this is supported on various 32-bit platforms  
</I>&gt;<i> that eLua is running on.  IIRC, the LM3S boards can do interrupts on  
</I>&gt;<i> any pin.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> With this in mind, this is what I came up with:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> int platform_adc_exists( unsigned id ); // generic, it will be part  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of src/common.c
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> u16 platform_adc_sample( unsigned id ); // sample the specified ADC  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> channel
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK.  So this will return the latest sample collected?  Does it block  
</I>&gt;<i> waiting for completion if the latest one hasn't finished yet?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, should this behavior be different in continuous vs single  
</I>&gt;<i> shot? i.e.:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Single Shot: wait for sample if not ready
</I>&gt;<i> Continuous: take whatever the last completed sample was?  wait for  
</I>&gt;<i> next sample? (I think the former would make more sense as a reason  
</I>&gt;<i> to use continuous sampling).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> void platform_adc_start( unsigned id ); // starts a conversion on  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the specified ADC channel and returns immediately
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> int platform_adc_is_done( unsigned id ); // returns 1 if the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> conversion on the specified channel ended, 0 otherwise
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wonder if in the case of using an interpreted language like Lua  
</I>&gt;<i> that one might be converting values fast enough that having some  
</I>&gt;<i> sort of loop waiting for the data to be done might not be fruitful,  
</I>&gt;<i> at least in single shot mode?  Certainly, one is more likely to need  
</I>&gt;<i> this if one wants to know if a burst has completed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> void platform_adc_set_mode( unsigned id, int mode ); // sets the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mode on the specified ADC channel to either &quot;single shot&quot; or  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;continuous&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm.. what about adding a filtered/smoothed mode? By this I don't  
</I>&gt;<i> mean anything particularly intense, perhaps just a ring buffer of a  
</I>&gt;<i> set length that gets averaged whenever platform_adc_sample is  
</I>&gt;<i> called.  I find myself frequently doing things like this when  
</I>&gt;<i> sampling things that are noisier than the best resolution the ADC  
</I>&gt;<i> can deliver.  My only thought here would be that the C code might do  
</I>&gt;<i> this faster than doing the averaging in Lua.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One way to handle this somewhat elegantly would be to not even add  
</I>&gt;<i> anything to the mode function, just have the default buffer be of  
</I>&gt;<i> length 1, and under this condition, no smoothing is done.  If you  
</I>&gt;<i> want it, use the following function to enable the rolling average:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> void platform_adc_set_smoothing( unsigned id, int length ); // sets  
</I>&gt;<i> window length/buffer size for moving average filter
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does this seem too much to have in the library?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> void platform_adc_burst( unsigned id, u16* buf, unsigned count, u32  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> frequency ); // burst conversion: read &quot;count&quot; samples from the ADC  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> channel &quot;id&quot;, storing the results in &quot;buf&quot;. The samples are read at  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> periodic intervals, the period is given by &quot;frequency&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I like this as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One thing that might be interesting to provide as well, would be  
</I>&gt;<i> some method to do this type of recording directly to a binary file  
</I>&gt;<i> in the mini filesystem or onto an SD card or something similar.   
</I>&gt;<i> This could be useful if one wants to capture more data than can be  
</I>&gt;<i> held in SRAM at once, but the sampling rate would have to drop down  
</I>&gt;<i> to much to record and transfer data a machine connected to the micro.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I realize some of these things might extend beyond what could be  
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate for a simple module, but  I think they could be useful  
</I>&gt;<i> just the same.  Also, I think the original functions make sense to  
</I>&gt;<i> get working as an initial implementation before making any of the  
</I>&gt;<i> extensions I'm proposing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thoughts?
