<PRE>Overall, those make a good core for the ADC functions.  I think a few  
additions might be nice as well.

I agree with the use of the timer as a conversion clock.

In a related vein, one thing that I've not used on micros that much,  
but have on dedicated ADC boards is the use of triggers for sampling.   
This would be particularly useful for burst sampling.  Sometimes this  
is done based on the signal itself, but often with a digital trigger.   
The digital trigger should be pretty easy to do by having the kickoff  
be interrupt driven.  If a board doesn't support external interrupts,  
you could always emulate it by polling, although it's not as good.

I guess this brings up the question:  do we allow arbitrary pin  
selection regardless of whether it will generate interrupts?  I have  
less knowledge of how this is supported on various 32-bit platforms  
that eLua is running on.  IIRC, the LM3S boards can do interrupts on  
any pin.

&gt;<i> With this in mind, this is what I came up with:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> int platform_adc_exists( unsigned id ); // generic, it will be part  
</I>&gt;<i> of src/common.c
</I>&gt;<i> u16 platform_adc_sample( unsigned id ); // sample the specified ADC  
</I>&gt;<i> channel
</I>
OK.  So this will return the latest sample collected?  Does it block  
waiting for completion if the latest one hasn't finished yet?

Also, should this behavior be different in continuous vs single shot?  
i.e.:

Single Shot: wait for sample if not ready
Continuous: take whatever the last completed sample was?  wait for  
next sample? (I think the former would make more sense as a reason to  
use continuous sampling).


&gt;<i> void platform_adc_start( unsigned id ); // starts a conversion on  
</I>&gt;<i> the specified ADC channel and returns immediately
</I>&gt;<i> int platform_adc_is_done( unsigned id ); // returns 1 if the  
</I>&gt;<i> conversion on the specified channel ended, 0 otherwise
</I>
I wonder if in the case of using an interpreted language like Lua that  
one might be converting values fast enough that having some sort of  
loop waiting for the data to be done might not be fruitful, at least  
in single shot mode?  Certainly, one is more likely to need this if  
one wants to know if a burst has completed.

&gt;<i> void platform_adc_set_mode( unsigned id, int mode ); // sets the  
</I>&gt;<i> mode on the specified ADC channel to either &quot;single shot&quot; or  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;continuous&quot;
</I>
Hmm.. what about adding a filtered/smoothed mode? By this I don't mean  
anything particularly intense, perhaps just a ring buffer of a set  
length that gets averaged whenever platform_adc_sample is called.  I  
find myself frequently doing things like this when sampling things  
that are noisier than the best resolution the ADC can deliver.  My  
only thought here would be that the C code might do this faster than  
doing the averaging in Lua.

One way to handle this somewhat elegantly would be to not even add  
anything to the mode function, just have the default buffer be of  
length 1, and under this condition, no smoothing is done.  If you want  
it, use the following function to enable the rolling average:

void platform_adc_set_smoothing( unsigned id, int length ); // sets  
window length/buffer size for moving average filter

Does this seem too much to have in the library?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> void platform_adc_burst( unsigned id, u16* buf, unsigned count, u32  
</I>&gt;<i> frequency ); // burst conversion: read &quot;count&quot; samples from the ADC  
</I>&gt;<i> channel &quot;id&quot;, storing the results in &quot;buf&quot;. The samples are read at  
</I>&gt;<i> periodic intervals, the period is given by &quot;frequency&quot;.
</I>
I like this as well.

One thing that might be interesting to provide as well, would be some  
method to do this type of recording directly to a binary file in the  
mini filesystem or onto an SD card or something similar.  This could  
be useful if one wants to capture more data than can be held in SRAM  
at once, but the sampling rate would have to drop down to much to  
record and transfer data a machine connected to the micro.


I realize some of these things might extend beyond what could be  
appropriate for a simple module, but  I think they could be useful  
just the same.  Also, I think the original functions make sense to get  
working as an initial implementation before making any of the  
extensions I'm proposing.

Thoughts?
