<PRE>&gt;<i> Oh, but timers can do so much more then just generate delays.  This is why
</I>&gt;<i> I proposed such a flexible interface.  As for caring what functionality a
</I>&gt;<i> platform has, IMO, since this is an embedded system and users would be
</I>&gt;<i> writing software that is closer to the hardware, I would argue that an eLua
</I>&gt;<i> user *would* want to know if the timer was 8, 16, or 32 bits.  Even if they
</I>&gt;<i> are just doing delays, that knowledge would be invaluable in that it could
</I>&gt;<i> tell you minimum timer resolution and maximum timeout values.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You're right, timers can do much more than just generate delays, I was
simplifying to make a point, the same principle applies to any timer
operation. As for your idea that the users would want to know what kind of
hardware they're using, I could argue that since they're doing that, they
might as well know if their timers can do capture or not :), so querying for
capabilities becomes kinda redundant in this context. And for
minimum/maximum timer resolution, we already have
tmr.getmindelay/tmr.getmaxdelay. Which are much more useful in this
particular situation, since knowing if a timer is 8/16/32 bits tells only
half of the story, you'd also need the timer frequency and a calculator
somewhere :) This is why I still stand by my initial point, which I'd like
to reformulate a bit: yes, the user should know his platform, he just
shouldn't care that much about it. To me it's more natural to call functions
like &quot;getmindelay&quot; that completely hide the hardware (and allow for other
neat stuff, like the virtual timers that I implemented recently) than to try
to figure this out from the hardware. After all, Lua is a high level
language, and although the programmer does indeed use it at a level that's
very close to the hardware, he might not want to feel this. Much like most C
programmer out there don't want to feel that there's some assembly code
lurking in the shadows of their beautifully intended code blocks :)


&gt;<i> Yes actually I have done quite a bit, but in C and not Lua, where an array
</I>&gt;<i> would take up less space.  Remember I specified that the array members are
</I>&gt;<i> static constant objects (could be your rotable, or just light userdata
</I>&gt;<i> preallocated in rom), so the only space used would be for the array itself,
</I>&gt;<i> which could be forceably destroyed after its done being used by calling the
</I>&gt;<i> garbage collector.  The table is basically just a function table so it need
</I>&gt;<i> no dynamic storage itself.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Ah, OK, I got it now. You're right, with my patch this doesn't add at all to
the RAM consumption.

STM32 will allow this, and I believe some Coldfire processors can as well.
&gt;<i>
</I>
But you probably still agree that most micros don't allow you to do this.

Calling pair on a channel that does not support pairing is invalid. ;) I
&gt;<i> would assume that users of the interface would use the capabilities
</I>&gt;<i> functionality to query channels before performing operations on them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This is the thing that I dislike the most in your approach: the continous
query/execute operation. It kinda reminds me of COM :), but this is not the
main reason I dislike it, it's because I find it very tiring to write code
in this way (asking if you can do something before you actually do it; I
like more the &quot;bad boy&quot; approach: do it directly. Also less safe, it's also
much easier to code IMO). And again, I think this contradicts with the idea
of &quot;the user must know his hardware&quot;, in the sense that the query
capabilities step becomes unnecessary.


&gt;<i> Possibly, but thats why the capabilities functionality exists. I really
</I>&gt;<i> love self documenting code. ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I understand, and I think this is an important difference in our coding
styles. I too like self-documenting code, but to the point where
self-documentation becomes a purpose in itself, thus altering the code too
much.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - false sense of portability: if someone sees a code that says
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;16bit_timers[1]:pair(twin)&quot; he might think something between the lines of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;cool, eLua can do pair, so I can get any board I want and enjoy this&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (let's face it: given a situation like this most people aren't going to RTFM
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> until it's too late :) ). But when you say:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lm3s.tmr.pair(0)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tmr.delay(0,delay)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it's a very strong hint that this code might not work on anything else
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than LM3S.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Very true, but I assume that the users of eLua know something about the
</I>&gt;<i> hardware they are using (after all they have to at least know what pins the
</I>&gt;<i> timers connect to!) and are familliar
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>enough with embedded systems programming to know that all platforms are not
&gt;<i> created equal. :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
So, mister self-documenting guy :), don't you think that:

lm3s.tmr.pair(0)
tmr.delay(0, us)

is more self documenting than:

timers[0].pair(0).delay(us) (or something similar)? :P

In my mind the timers object(s) will be eternal and never be collected,
&gt;<i> there for the unlock method must be explicitly called.  The reason for this
</I>&gt;<i> is the &quot;set it and forget it&quot; mode of operation used for some operations.
</I>&gt;<i> If your using a timer to generate a 10KHz square wave you only need to
</I>&gt;<i> configure the timer once, and then leave it alone for the duration of the
</I>&gt;<i> program. At the same time you don't want some other piece of code
</I>&gt;<i> reconfiguring the timer, nor do you want the timer to be reset when it goes
</I>&gt;<i> out of program scope.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Very true, and this is why I liked the idea very much. You do have another
approach in this case(which is used by my virtual timers implementation): if
a timer is dedicated to a specific set of operations and you don't want it
disturbed, simply don't expose it to the Lua interface.


&gt;<i> The other reason to have the timers be eternal objects is you can set them
</I>&gt;<i> up in your startup code and then drop the reference, later on in another Lua
</I>&gt;<i> thread, ISR (not yet maybe?), or coroutine you can then reget that timer
</I>&gt;<i> object from the system and manipulate it without ever having to pass the
</I>&gt;<i> object around.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You can already do this in the current implementation, as it uses univeral
IDs that are usable from anywhere in the code.
And yes, we'll have ISRs written directly in Lua (not sure this is what you
meant, but I thought I'll mention it anyway :) ).


&gt;<i> Also, real harware is eternal, how many times have you used a CPU that had
</I>&gt;<i> a timer that disappeared when you forgot it was there? ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I'd rather not answer this :D


&gt;<i> Basically I envision a timer to be lock()ed whenever its being used, even
</I>&gt;<i> if its not currently referenced in any code in the current scope, and
</I>&gt;<i> unlock()ed if the timer is idle and free to be retasked to do something
</I>&gt;<i> else.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
And this is why your idea seems so good. I'll think of a nice, generic way
to implement it.


&gt;<i> Thanks for the discussion on this, I think if we keep this up we will end
</I>&gt;<i> up with quite a robust code base!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
So it seems! Thank you too.

Best,
Bogdan

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hi again,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> As most of you know by now, our platform interface is generic enough to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> be implemented by any eLua target. The unfortunate side effect of this is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that all the (potentially cool) specific features of each platform/board are
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> left forgotten, and there's no way to access them directly. As some
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (probably most) people would gladly sacrifice portability over the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> possibility of taking full advantage of their CPUs, we need to find a way to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> address this need.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This is my proposal:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> - every platform will have a module which name is the same as the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> platform name (&quot;lm3s&quot; for LM3S, &quot;stm32&quot; for STM32, you got the picture :) )
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> - this module will have two types of &quot;submodules&quot; (for want a better
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> term; what I mean is that each module will be able to embed other modules
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> inside it):
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   1. submodules with the same name as the &quot;standard&quot; modules. For
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> example: lm3s.uart, lm3s.tmr, lm3s.pio and so on. These will add to the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> functionality of the &quot;standard&quot; modules by providing platform-specific
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> functions.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   2. submodules that implement features found only on that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> platform/board. Dado's &quot;disp&quot; module is a very good example of this. By
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> having a module &quot;lm3s.disp&quot; we know for sure that we're reffering to a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> display that can be found on the LM3S board. This is a temporary solution,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> as a generic display architecture would be a much better choice, but it's
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> still good enough for our needs IMO.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> What say you?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Best,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Bogdan
