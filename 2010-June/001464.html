<PRE>&gt;<i> What I was intending to do, at least as a first attempt, was to keep the
</I>&gt;<i> interrupt processing in C, and keep it as generic and simple as
</I>&gt;<i> possible. There is very little that *must* be done in an interrupt
</I>&gt;<i> handler, typically.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
True, and what I had in mind is to put the interrupt ID in a queue (maybe
even a heap, which would be a nice and fast way to implement interrupt
priorities, although I'm not sure about this yet), set a Lua hook and then
let the Lua handler take over :) Of course, a mechanism can (and will) be
imagined that allows both C and Lua code to use interrupt handlers in the
way described above.


&gt;<i> So the job of the interrupt handler is to package up into an event
</I>&gt;<i> object:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * the identity of the interrupt itself (including perhaps the identity
</I>&gt;<i> of the interrupt source if there are multiple possibilities for a single
</I>&gt;<i> interrupt)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * whatever other data (if any) that is *always* relevant to handling
</I>&gt;<i> that interrupt (perhaps a received character for a UART
</I>&gt;<i> receive-buffer-not-empty interrupt, or a timer value for a timer input
</I>&gt;<i> capture interrupt)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Precisely.


&gt;<i> and then publish or post that event object for consumption by the state
</I>&gt;<i> machines.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
... or simply let the C/Lua interrupt handler take over.

This way, the interrupts are kept fast and short, and won't need to be
&gt;<i> changed for alternative uses of the various peripherals.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Sure, this is exactly what I had in mind too, save the part with the state
machine (which is optional in my design).


&gt;<i> &gt; The eLua HTTP server is something hand-crafted in half a week-end, so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not really a good reference :) It can be rewritten quite nicely using
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; coroutines (once the network support in eLua gets better itself,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because now it's not really usable for handling multiple connections).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How are coroutines handled in eLua? Is there explicit support for them,
</I>&gt;<i> or are they just done using continuations?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
There isn't any difference between eLua coroutines regular Lua coroutines.
They are implemented and behave exactly the same.


&gt;<i> Is there direct support for (say) peripheral register access?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It is, via the CPU module:

<A HREF="http://www.eluaproject.net/en_refman_gen_cpu.html">http://www.eluaproject.net/en_refman_gen_cpu.html</A>

It's actually a quite dangerous module that you can use to access the whole
memory space freely :) But this does let you access all of the CPU's memory
mapped registers as a side effect. And it has a nice and simple way to
define register names (as described in the link above), which makes one's
life a bit easier.


&gt;<i> If not,
</I>&gt;<i> could a kind of boxed pointer be made that allows for access to the
</I>&gt;<i> various register spaces? I could see doing this in a bit of a condensed
</I>&gt;<i> form: say 20-24 bits for an address offset, and a few bits to describe
</I>&gt;<i> the space (flash, RAM, a few different peripheral register spaces).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Right now, we don't even need boxed pointers. A 32 bit value is enough to
represent any address for all the targets currently supported by eLua. What
you said makes sense for Harvard architectures, but we're not using these
yet. Well, technically speaking the ARM966E-S (STR9) is a Harvard
architecture at its core, but it uses some clever tricks to mask this from
the rest of the system, effectively exposing an unified memory space. I'll
worry about Harvard architectures when I meet one that is a good candidate
for eLua :)
Also, all of the targets used by eLua have memory mapped registers, so
pointers represented as 32 bit values work here too.

This allows for peripheral handling code to be written in Lua itself,
&gt;<i> and not have to use code and RAM space for platform-specific modules
</I>&gt;<i> that may not be needed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Sure, you can already do this.

&gt;<i> You'd need at least two things to implement the above:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. interrupt support directly in eLua (and we'll have this soon, as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; previously stated)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. a Lua module that implements the CPU specific functions needed for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; DMA, I2C and whatever else. We don't have that, but they can certainly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be written, and they are perfectly inline with eLua's current
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; architecture (they are called &quot;platform specific modules&quot; in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; official documentation). We try to focus on the core eLua code +
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; generic modules most of the time, and let people write their own
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; platform specific modules for their platform of choice when there's a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; need for that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Understood. I just don't see why they need to be in C.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
They don't _need_ to be in C, this is purely a matter of aesthetics (and a
problem of maintenance as a side effect). This call:

stm32.dma.enable_channel( 1 )

is much easier to understand than this (not actual code, but it illustrates
my point):

cpu.w32( cpu.DMA_CHANNEL1_BASE, xxx )
cpu.w32( cpu.DMA_CHANNEL1_STATE, yyy )
.........................

This is probably the only reason we're writing platform specific modules :)
Otherwise one could in theory do absolutely everything from eLua with the
cpu module.


&gt;<i> Yes, I don't see that VM alterations would be needed, other than perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> allowing for a type to represent peripheral registers so that user Lua
</I>&gt;<i> code can be written to do the bulk of the work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Even for architectures without memory mapped registers, I think a 32-bit
integer would be enough to represent this. Surely this becomes a question of
type safety, but whoever handles low level stuff like this generally knows
to be careful :)


&gt;<i> Though it may also be helpful to separately manage event objects (so as
</I>&gt;<i> not to burden the GC with these transient objects that can be allocated
</I>&gt;<i> from their own pools).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You mean bypassing Lua's GC mechanism? Sure, this is OK as long as you
remember to deallocate all your data structures manually.


&gt;<i> I'm proposing something even simpler than coroutines: just subroutines.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Each state machine has one or more state handler routines.
</I>&gt;<i> There is an implicit &quot;top&quot; handler that is the parent of the topmost
</I>&gt;<i> user state handlers; it merely ignores all events.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When an event is delivered to a state machine, that machine's current
</I>&gt;<i> state handler routine is called and passed the event.
</I>&gt;<i> That routine does whatever it wants to (possibly nothing) with the
</I>&gt;<i> event, returning an indication that:
</I>&gt;<i> * it handled the event
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * it ignored the event
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * it wants its parent state's handler to handle the event (also
</I>&gt;<i> returning a pointer to that handler)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * it has handled the event and has changed the current state (also
</I>&gt;<i> returning a pointer to the new handler)
</I>&gt;<i> Typically, the structure of the handler routines is a big switch on the
</I>&gt;<i> event type.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Additionally, there are a few special event types that are used for
</I>&gt;<i> state machine actions:
</I>&gt;<i> * state machine initialization * state entry * state exit * probe (which
</I>&gt;<i> all handlers pass to their superstate handlers, thereby providing
</I>&gt;<i> dynamic state hierarchy discovery)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Roughly, this is the QP implementation from the user point of view:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> typedef uint8_t QState;
</I>&gt;<i> typedef QState (*QStateHandler)(void *me, QEvent const *e);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> #define Q_HANDLED() ((QState)0)
</I>&gt;<i> #define Q_IGNORED() ((QState)1)
</I>&gt;<i> #define Q_TRAN(s)   ((me-&gt;state = (QStateHandler)(s)), ((QState)2))
</I>&gt;<i> #define Q_SUPER(s)  ((me-&gt;state = (QStateHandler)(s)), ((QState)3))
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> QState MyMachine_SomeTopLevelState(MyMachine *me, QEvent const *e) {
</I>&gt;<i>    switch (e-&gt;sig) {
</I>&gt;<i>        case Q_ENTRY_SIG: { /* entry actions */ return Q_HANDLED(); }
</I>&gt;<i>        case Q_EXIT_SIG: { /* exit actions */ return Q_HANDLED(); }
</I>&gt;<i>        case SOME_SIG_I_HANDLE: { /* actions */ return Q_HANDLED(); }
</I>&gt;<i>        case SOME_OTHER_SIG_I_HANDLE: { /* actions */ return
</I>&gt;<i> Q_TRAN(&amp;MyMachine_SomeOtherState); }
</I>&gt;<i>        case SOME_SIG_I_DONT_HANDLE: { /* let my parent state handle
</I>&gt;<i> this */ return Q_SUPER(&amp;QHsm_top); }
</I>&gt;<i> /* ... */
</I>&gt;<i>    }
</I>&gt;<i>    return Q_SUPER(&amp;QHsm_top); /* default: let parent handle this */
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> QState MyMachine_SomeSubState(MyMachine *me, QEvent const *e) {
</I>&gt;<i>    switch (e-&gt;sig) {
</I>&gt;<i>        case Q_ENTRY_SIG: { /* entry actions */ return Q_HANDLED(); }
</I>&gt;<i>        case Q_EXIT_SIG: { /* exit actions */ return Q_HANDLED(); }
</I>&gt;<i>        case SOME_SIG_I_DONT_HANDLE: { /* let my parent state handle
</I>&gt;<i> this */ return Q_SUPER(&amp;MyMachine_SomeTopLevelState); }
</I>&gt;<i> /* ... */
</I>&gt;<i>    }
</I>&gt;<i>    return Q_SUPER(&amp;MyMachine_SomeTopLevelState); /* default: let parent
</I>&gt;<i> handle this */
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Thanks, I'm quite familiar with state machines myself and I fully understand
your point. I believe this can be implemented directly in Lua, or perharps
in a specialized C state machine module, maybe using a simple object model
to expose a nice interface, without any need to modify the core itself.

Big Loop is merely my name for that idiom, of course. And I don't think
&gt;<i> it's original, though I don't recall where I heard it first.
</I>&gt;<i> Can you give an example of an embedded application whose runtime needs
</I>&gt;<i> are better served by the Big Loop structure?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I wrote several simple applications like this (all on 8 and 16 bit MCUs),
such as data loggers, current converters, smart terminals, and even some
basic DSP blocks. Basically, they would all block in a while(1) in main(),
waiting to process some data. Sure, the CPU spends all the time in this
loop, but the point is that sometimes this is exactly what you need it to do
:<i>) Adding a state machine in this case would've meant writing unnecessary
</I>complex code. Obviously this isn't applicable for more complex applications.



&gt;<i> I am not concerned here with considerations of programmer convenience or
</I>&gt;<i> aesthetics.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to use a more domain-specific language to specify the state
</I>&gt;<i> machine structure, so the details of the switch statements, etc. would
</I>&gt;<i> be wrapped in some syntactic sugar (for a text-based language) or would
</I>&gt;<i> be invisible (being generated as eLua bytecode from a graphical
</I>&gt;<i> description) in a graphical language.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I understand your point now, I think. You want to use eLua for an
environment based completely on state machines. This is actually very cool,
and you won't hear me complaining about it :)

I imagine that the code for actions and condition testing could be
&gt;<i> specified comfortably in Lua itself.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Definitely. You don't need any other domain-specific language, Lua is more
than capable to do the job.


&gt;<i> I would not be making a &quot;derived work&quot; (i.e. not doing a &quot;port&quot;), merely
</I>&gt;<i> using the ideas and structure of QP.
</I>&gt;<i> For instance, my Ruby implementation uses a more Ruby-friendly method
</I>&gt;<i> for finding the least-common ancestor of two states (needed for calling
</I>&gt;<i> exit and entry handlers during a transition).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Then by all means, please go for it. I'm 100% positive that having a fully
defined state-machine oriented development model in eLua would make a lot of
people happy.

Best,
Bogdan
