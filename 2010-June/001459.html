<PRE>Hi,

On Mon, Jun 21, 2010 at 4:04 AM, Ned Konz &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/elua-dev">ned at productcreationstudio.com</A>&gt;wrote:

&gt;<i> Hello folks,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to introduce myself. I'm new to Lua, but have been doing embedded
</I>&gt;<i> system work since 1975 (on the MC6800 microprocessor). I'm now using
</I>&gt;<i> Cortex-M3 processors, and have been thinking once more about the usefulness
</I>&gt;<i> of a VM on such a chip.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Nice to meet you.


&gt;<i> My own interests don't necessarily include a self-hosted language system
</I>&gt;<i> (though it's nice to have, I don't know how much space the compiler
</I>&gt;<i> requires); I'd prefer to spend the flash on system capabilities and extended
</I>&gt;<i> domain-specific vocabularies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Roughly, you can do fine with eLua in about 200k of Flash on Cortex-M3, or
even less. tt depends on the components you choose to include in your build.
I'm much more worried about RAM than Flash most of the time.

The eLua VM looks attractive as a dynamic runtime engine, though.
&gt;<i>
</I>
It's definitely the most atractive one I found. There is also a very good
(and free) BASIC variant for micros, with source code and excellent
documentation (the VM itself is documented quite nicely) at
<A HREF="http://www.compuphase.com/pawn/pawn.htm.">http://www.compuphase.com/pawn/pawn.htm.</A> Yes, I know we're talking about
BASIC :), but the VM was quite OK from what I can remember, and the
documentation is outstanding.


&gt;<i> However, the runtime architecture that eLua currently uses (which AFAICT is
</I>&gt;<i> roughly the same as Lua on the desktop) has a several limitations that I'd
</I>&gt;<i> like to change:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * No way to do interesting work in Lua from interrupt handlers. Unless you
</I>&gt;<i> want to use the peripherals the way the driver writer had provided for,
</I>&gt;<i> you're out of luck.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
We'll have interrupt support in eLua soon, although it won't be without
limitations, as the Lua VM is not interruptible. I plan to implement it
using standard Lua hooks (I actually have some proof on concept code that
works quite nicely), which will be a huge problem if the VM remains stuck in
a blocking function (I/O for example). But I don't know of a better way of
doing this, at least not without using an OS with threading support.


&gt;<i> * The Big Loop structure. The (Big Loop) + (interrupt handlers) scheme has
</I>&gt;<i> proven to be inflexible and a poor match for the mostly event-driven needs
</I>&gt;<i> of embedded systems, especially where concurrency is required. Existing
</I>&gt;<i> threading schemes and primitives (especially semaphores!) are difficult to
</I>&gt;<i> write reliable code with.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A demonstration of the difficulties of this structure can be seen with the
</I>&gt;<i> uIP demo code; uIP generates event notifications via callbacks, but the eLua
</I>&gt;<i> HTTP server application is itself blocking in a Big Loop. So the &quot;impedance
</I>&gt;<i> mismatch&quot; between the lightweight event notifications from uIP and the
</I>&gt;<i> blocking socket interface in the server requires extra code and would be
</I>&gt;<i> hard to multi-thread.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The eLua HTTP server is something hand-crafted in half a week-end, so not
really a good reference :) It can be rewritten quite nicely using coroutines
(once the network support in eLua gets better itself, because now it's not
really usable for handling multiple connections).

What I'd like to do instead is to implement a system using the eLua VM that
&gt;<i> does this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Allows for eLua peripheral control at a level equivalent to that
</I>&gt;<i> currently done in C code. Once you get past the simple configuration of I/O
</I>&gt;<i> ports, the complexity and richness of existing microcontroller peripherals
</I>&gt;<i> makes it hard to fully use the capabilities of the chip. For instance, I can
</I>&gt;<i> set up the STM32F10x peripherals so that the timer's input capture event
</I>&gt;<i> triggers a DMA from a GPIO port to memory, at the same time that I'm using
</I>&gt;<i> another DMA channel to transfer bytes from the I2C receive into memory, with
</I>&gt;<i> interrupts at the beginning of each I2C transfer. It would be hard if not
</I>&gt;<i> impossible to do that in eLua the way it stands now (I think; I'd love to
</I>&gt;<i> hear that this would be possible to do).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It's not hard, it's just not imlemented yet. You'd need at least two things
to implement the above:

1. interrupt support directly in eLua (and we'll have this soon, as
previously stated)
2. a Lua module that implements the CPU specific functions needed for DMA,
I2C and whatever else. We don't have that, but they can certainly be
written, and they are perfectly inline with eLua's current architecture
(they are called &quot;platform specific modules&quot; in the official documentation).
We try to focus on the core eLua code + generic modules most of the time,
and let people write their own platform specific modules for their platform
of choice when there's a need for that.


&gt;<i> * Allows eLua programs to be structured as one or more hierarchical state
</I>&gt;<i> machines, each with its own runtime context and event queue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Responds to interrupts by packaging up the minimal context (at least
</I>&gt;<i> which interrupt occurred, and perhaps which of several interrupt sources
</I>&gt;<i> caused it) into an event and delivering it to (subscribed or all) state
</I>&gt;<i> machines.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Does cooperative multi-tasking by using a run-to-completion scheme: each
</I>&gt;<i> state machine that is ready to run (i.e. has an event ready to react to)
</I>&gt;<i> gets its current state's handler routine run with the next event; these are
</I>&gt;<i> not preempted but rather do their work and return.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You mean cooperative multi-tasking at coroutine level? Or with an OS? If you
mean multi-tasking at coroutine level, what you wrote above can probably be
implemented directly in eLua (+interrupt handlers), without any need to
modify the VM or any other part of the code. Please let me know if I'm
missing something here :)


&gt;<i> It seems to me that this would not require any kind of thread support in
</I>&gt;<i> eLua itself (as the state machine executive is itself a single-threaded
</I>&gt;<i> program), and that it would better match the needs of embedded systems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I'm hesitant in naming a development methodology &quot;better&quot; than another in
most cases. An event+state machine based model (as they are used together
more often than not) is a great thing for particular classes of applications
(protocol implementations being the first example that comes to mind), but
it's hard to generalize this. Some applications are perfectly happy with the
Big Loop structure (thanks, I didn't know this is the official name :) ),
others can do all their work only in interrupt handlers without having to
worry much about synchronization, and so on.


&gt;<i> For a good example of how clean an equivalent embedded HTTP server demo can
</I>&gt;<i> be (using the lwIP TCP/IP stack, which also uses callbacks like uIP), look
</I>&gt;<i> at <A HREF="http://www.state-machine.com/lwip/">http://www.state-machine.com/lwip/</A> where Miro Samek has provided an
</I>&gt;<i> example program that includes lwIP, an HTTP server with SSI and CGI
</I>&gt;<i> capabilities, and the &quot;Dining Philosopher Problem&quot; demo (which is a
</I>&gt;<i> multi-threaded simulation).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have ported the QP architecture (described at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.state-machine.com">http://www.state-machine.com</A>) to Ruby and Squeak Smalltalk, and have used
</I>&gt;<i> it in C programs in embedded systems; I've found it to be very lightweight
</I>&gt;<i> and a good way to write embedded programs. I would probably use a very
</I>&gt;<i> similar scheme for eLua.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
&gt;<i> What do you think?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I think this is a great idea for many applications, but not all of them. All
in all, I'd be very interested to see something like this running in eLua :)
One note though: QP seems to be GLPed, so not compatible with eLua (which is
mostly MIT/BSD). So a direct port might not be possible.

Best,
Bogdan
