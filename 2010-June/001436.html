<PRE>Hi guys

</I>&gt;<i> I don't know of any env vars used during the eLua build that is not managed by the scons script (our make tool). Also, to build the toolchains (and in the case of CodeSourcery it is basically a simple install on Windows), only a couple of env vars are used and none of them depend on Lua neither.

The reason for my question was that based on the webpage &lt;<A HREF="http://www.eluaproject.net/en_building_win.html">http://www.eluaproject.net/en_building_win.html</A>&gt; you think that Lua is part of the toolchain for building eLua. As I develop on Mac OS X, I need the Windows side only for building and flashing, so I want(ed) to avoid to install a rather, say, comprehensive environment such as Lua for Windows. I think the mention of Lua as part of the /building/ toolchain should be removed, are amended with a corresponding remark.

For the other parts, though, I followed the instructions and installed CodeSourcery Lite Edition, Python, and scons. All environment vars were set by the installations. I downloaded the eLua 0.7 source, checked the configuration file against &lt;<A HREF="http://www.eluaproject.net/en_building.html#configuring">http://www.eluaproject.net/en_building.html#configuring</A>&gt; (as far as I understand it at this point :-)), and gave it a try -- done, binary built! Cool. I did get some warnings, though, including ones complaining about non-installed Microsoft Visual Studio.

Anyway, I flashed it to the EK-LM3S6965, and it works... OK, didn't test all the modules yet, but hey, it's a start! :-)

Thanks for your support.

Cheers
-- Stefan
