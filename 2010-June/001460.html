What have you identified as the minimum RAM requirements? Given that

</I>
What I was intending to do, at least as a first attempt, was to keep the
interrupt processing in C, and keep it as generic and simple as
possible. There is very little that *must* be done in an interrupt
handler, typically. 

So the job of the interrupt handler is to package up into an event
object: 

* the identity of the interrupt itself (including perhaps the identity
of the interrupt source if there are multiple possibilities for a single
interrupt) 

* whatever other data (if any) that is *always* relevant to handling
that interrupt (perhaps a received character for a UART
receive-buffer-not-empty interrupt, or a timer value for a timer input
capture interrupt) 

and then publish or post that event object for consumption by the state
machines. 

That's it. 

This way, the interrupts are kept fast and short, and won't need to be
changed for alternative uses of the various peripherals. 

The state machines are, of course, welcome to use less of the supplied
data (if we're just interested in the rate of received characters, we
can discard the characters themselves), or do something with it (like
buffering received characters somewhere), or go out and get additional
state from the peripheral status registers. 
&gt;<i> The eLua HTTP server is something hand-crafted in half a week-end, so
</I>&gt;<i> not really a good reference :) It can be rewritten quite nicely using
</I>&gt;<i> coroutines (once the network support in eLua gets better itself,
</I>&gt;<i> because now it's not really usable for handling multiple connections).
</I>

How are coroutines handled in eLua? Is there explicit support for them,
or are they just done using continuations? 

&gt;<i> &gt; What I'd like to do instead is to implement a system using the eLua
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; VM that does this:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * Allows for eLua peripheral control at a level equivalent to that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; currently done in C code. Once you get past the simple configuration
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of I/O ports, the complexity and richness of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; existing microcontroller peripherals makes it hard to fully use the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; capabilities of the chip. For instance, I can set up the STM32F10x
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; peripherals so that the timer's input capture event triggers a DMA
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from a GPIO port to memory, at the same time that I'm using another
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; DMA channel to transfer bytes from the I2C receive into memory, with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interrupts at the beginning of each I2C transfer. It would be hard
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if not impossible to do that in eLua the way it stands now (I think;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'd love to hear that this would be possible to do).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's not hard, it's just not imlemented yet. 
</I>

Is there direct support for (say) peripheral register access? If not,
could a kind of boxed pointer be made that allows for access to the
various register spaces? I could see doing this in a bit of a condensed
form: say 20-24 bits for an address offset, and a few bits to describe
the space (flash, RAM, a few different peripheral register spaces). 

This allows for peripheral handling code to be written in Lua itself,
and not have to use code and RAM space for platform-specific modules
that may not be needed. 

&gt;<i> You'd need at least two things to implement the above:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. interrupt support directly in eLua (and we'll have this soon, as
</I>&gt;<i> previously stated)
</I>&gt;<i> 2. a Lua module that implements the CPU specific functions needed for
</I>&gt;<i> DMA, I2C and whatever else. We don't have that, but they can certainly
</I>&gt;<i> be written, and they are perfectly inline with eLua's current
</I>&gt;<i> architecture (they are called &quot;platform specific modules&quot; in the
</I>&gt;<i> official documentation). We try to focus on the core eLua code +
</I>&gt;<i> generic modules most of the time, and let people write their own
</I>&gt;<i> platform specific modules for their platform of choice when there's a
</I>&gt;<i> need for that.
</I>
Understood. I just don't see why they need to be in C. 
&gt;<i> &gt; * Does cooperative multi-tasking by using a run-to-completion
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; scheme: each state machine that is ready to run (i.e. has an event
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ready to react to) gets its current state's handler routine run
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with the next event; these are not preempted but rather do their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; work and return.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> You mean cooperative multi-tasking at coroutine level? Or with an OS?
</I>&gt;<i> If you mean multi-tasking at coroutine level, what you wrote above can
</I>&gt;<i> probably be implemented directly in eLua (+interrupt handlers),
</I>&gt;<i> without any need to modify the VM or any other part of the code.
</I>&gt;<i> Please let me know if I'm missing something here :)
</I>
Yes, I don't see that VM alterations would be needed, other than perhaps
allowing for a type to represent peripheral registers so that user Lua
code can be written to do the bulk of the work.

Though it may also be helpful to separately manage event objects (so as
not to burden the GC with these transient objects that can be allocated
from their own pools). 
I'm proposing something even simpler than coroutines: just subroutines.

Each state machine has one or more state handler routines. 
There is an implicit &quot;top&quot; handler that is the parent of the topmost
user state handlers; it merely ignores all events.

When an event is delivered to a state machine, that machine's current
state handler routine is called and passed the event. 
That routine does whatever it wants to (possibly nothing) with the
event, returning an indication that: 
* it handled the event

* it ignored the event

* it wants its parent state's handler to handle the event (also
returning a pointer to that handler)

* it has handled the event and has changed the current state (also
returning a pointer to the new handler) 
Typically, the structure of the handler routines is a big switch on the
event type.

Additionally, there are a few special event types that are used for
state machine actions: 
* state machine initialization * state entry * state exit * probe (which
all handlers pass to their superstate handlers, thereby providing
dynamic state hierarchy discovery)

Roughly, this is the QP implementation from the user point of view:


typedef uint8_t QState;
typedef QState (*QStateHandler)(void *me, QEvent const *e);

#define Q_HANDLED() ((QState)0)
#define Q_IGNORED() ((QState)1)
#define Q_TRAN(s)   ((me-&gt;state = (QStateHandler)(s)), ((QState)2))
#define Q_SUPER(s)  ((me-&gt;state = (QStateHandler)(s)), ((QState)3))

QState MyMachine_SomeTopLevelState(MyMachine *me, QEvent const *e) {
    switch (e-&gt;sig) {
        case Q_ENTRY_SIG: { /* entry actions */ return Q_HANDLED(); }
        case Q_EXIT_SIG: { /* exit actions */ return Q_HANDLED(); }
        case SOME_SIG_I_HANDLE: { /* actions */ return Q_HANDLED(); }
        case SOME_OTHER_SIG_I_HANDLE: { /* actions */ return
Q_TRAN(&amp;MyMachine_SomeOtherState); }
        case SOME_SIG_I_DONT_HANDLE: { /* let my parent state handle
this */ return Q_SUPER(&amp;QHsm_top); }
/* ... */
    }
    return Q_SUPER(&amp;QHsm_top); /* default: let parent handle this */
}

QState MyMachine_SomeSubState(MyMachine *me, QEvent const *e) {
    switch (e-&gt;sig) {
        case Q_ENTRY_SIG: { /* entry actions */ return Q_HANDLED(); }
        case Q_EXIT_SIG: { /* exit actions */ return Q_HANDLED(); }
        case SOME_SIG_I_DONT_HANDLE: { /* let my parent state handle
this */ return Q_SUPER(&amp;MyMachine_SomeTopLevelState); }
/* ... */
    }
    return Q_SUPER(&amp;MyMachine_SomeTopLevelState); /* default: let parent
handle this */
}


&gt;<i> &gt; It seems to me that this would not require any kind of thread
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; support in eLua itself (as the state machine executive is itself a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; single-threaded program), and that it would better match the needs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of embedded systems.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm hesitant in naming a development methodology &quot;better&quot; than another
</I>&gt;<i> in most cases. An event+state machine based model (as they are used
</I>&gt;<i> together more often than not) is a great thing for particular classes
</I>&gt;<i> of applications (protocol implementations being the first example that
</I>&gt;<i> comes to mind), but it's hard to generalize this. Some applications
</I>&gt;<i> are perfectly happy with the Big Loop structure (thanks, I didn't know
</I>&gt;<i> this is the official name :) ), others can do all their work only in
</I>&gt;<i> interrupt handlers without having to worry much about synchronization,
</I>&gt;<i> and so on. 
</I>
Big Loop is merely my name for that idiom, of course. And I don't think
it's original, though I don't recall where I heard it first. 
Can you give an example of an embedded application whose runtime needs
are better served by the Big Loop structure?

I am not concerned here with considerations of programmer convenience or
aesthetics.

I would like to use a more domain-specific language to specify the state
machine structure, so the details of the switch statements, etc. would
be wrapped in some syntactic sugar (for a text-based language) or would
be invisible (being generated as eLua bytecode from a graphical
description) in a graphical language.

I imagine that the code for actions and condition testing could be
specified comfortably in Lua itself. 
&gt;<i> &gt; For a good example of how clean an equivalent embedded HTTP server
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; demo can be (using the lwIP TCP/IP stack, which also uses callbacks
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like uIP), look at <A HREF="http://www.state-machine.com/lwip/">http://www.state-machine.com/lwip/</A> where Miro
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Samek has provided an example program that includes lwIP, an HTTP
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; server with SSI and CGI capabilities, and the &quot;Dining Philosopher
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Problem&quot; demo (which is a multi-threaded simulation).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have ported the QP architecture (described at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://www.state-machine.com">http://www.state-machine.com</A>) to Ruby and Squeak Smalltalk, and have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; used it in C programs in embedded systems; I've found it to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; very lightweight and a good way to write embedded programs. I would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; probably use a very similar scheme for eLua.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What do you think?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> I think this is a great idea for many applications, but not all of
</I>&gt;<i> them. All in all, I'd be very interested to see something like this
</I>&gt;<i> running in eLua :) One note though: QP seems to be GLPed, so
</I>&gt;<i> not compatible with eLua (which is mostly MIT/BSD). So a direct port
</I>&gt;<i> might not be possible.
</I>
I would not be making a &quot;derived work&quot; (i.e. not doing a &quot;port&quot;), merely
using the ideas and structure of QP. 
For instance, my Ruby implementation uses a more Ruby-friendly method
for finding the least-common ancestor of two states (needed for calling
exit and entry handlers during a transition).
