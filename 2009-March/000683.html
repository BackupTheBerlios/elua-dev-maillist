Right, and it handles all the basic cell-character stuff.  Is it  
definitely needed?  I'm not sure, but I have a sneaking suspicion that  
one needs more than pyserial to print output/read input, and still  
have it behave like a term.

Certainly, though (I'm not suggesting that I love ncurses  
interfaces :-) ), even if that's not the case, you do get some other  
benefits to draw information about the current connection and progress  
for file transfers and the like.

Wrapping this all into a GUI I think requires a little more effort  
because if one does want to have a terminal emulator embedded into it,  
in order for the lua term stuff to work, you need to either find  
something that provides that or build your own.

Someone did build a terminal with python and PyGTK: <A HREF="http://reflog.googlepages.com/">http://reflog.googlepages.com/</A> 
, but I've not read through to see if it required building the  
terminal using pretty raw primitives, or if you got all that mostly  
for free.

</I>
A full dev environment would be quite nice :-)  I think if it's  
something that can be sketched out with a minimal amount of code in  
Python or some other language, it would be a good way to get started.

I would say that for getting a lot of users, it would be best to have  
something that can be installed on Mac, Linux/UNIX, and Windows, look  
fairly native, and require no messing around to get it working in the  
first place (so long as the hardware is all set up correctly).
