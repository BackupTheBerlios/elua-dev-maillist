Ant, the build system that seems to be preferred by the Java 
crowd, is completely unlike Make, and does not use make on the 
back end, unless extended with a custom build step that invokes 
make. It takes a whole-project view of the build, and IMHO 
doesn't mix well with the notion of building just this subtree 
of a project. On the other hand, the whole Java language design 
choice of storing source files in directory paths named after 
their fully-qualified class names is so hostile to that kind of 
development that you (or at least me, coming from a lot of 
background with make on more platforms than I want to count) 
don't even notice that lack as you fight all the other barriers 
that development in Java seems to throw your way.

I'm reasonably sure that attempting to get make to drive the 
build of a serious Java project would drive anyone around the bend.

Getting Ant to build &quot;foreign&quot; language (i.e. some C files 
implementing a few JNI classes) sources was surprisingly easy, 
unlike my attempts to do real work that needed &quot;custom&quot; (meaning 
non-standard) build steps in most IDEs. In some ways it was 
easier to get Ant to build them than it was to use the C code 
from the Java application. But that is part of a rant about Java 
that is even further off topic than this discussion of build 
systems ;-)

There is even NAnt, which is a port of Ant to the .NET universe.

One of the barriers to getting started with Ant that I noticed 
was its use of the full expressive power of XML to describe the 
build. For me, all that XML punctuation really gets in the way 
of what all boils down to wanting to describe the dependency 
graph, decorated by build instructions.

I've always felt that make does that part really well, with a 
minimum of extraneous punctuation.

Getting slightly closer to the list's topic, my only exposure to 
scons was not positive: for reasons that made sense at the time 
I needed to build VLC from sources on Solaris. Not only were the 
33 libraries a barmier (most of which needed patching, and all 
needed building on the target platform) but the final straw was 
tripping over one that needed scons to build, which meant 
finding a working Python for Solaris, and learning scons to fix 
the inevitable platform-specific build issues. By that point, 
the return on the investment became negative, and we abandoned 
the whole idea.

I have to agree with Mike's general message that a good build 
system really has to work out-of-the-box for distribution with a 
portable project. Otherwise, getting it setup and working 
becomes yet another barrier to adoption of the system.
