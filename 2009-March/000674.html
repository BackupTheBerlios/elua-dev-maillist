I haven't yet found something that is as easy to work with as  
TeraTerm, which I do find somewhat irritating.  For quick and dirty  
stuff (no transfers, just console) I just use screen, which one can  
fire up by just pointing it at the tty device (screen /dev/ttyUSB0  
115200).

I've tried a few things including minicom, and haven't been thrilled  
with them.  One thing that I just stumbled upon, and haven't tried yet  
is CuteCom (<A HREF="http://cutecom.sourceforge.net/">http://cutecom.sourceforge.net/</A>).  I'm going to try and  
compile that on my Mac, it looks like it's at least in the Ubuntu  
repositories though.

If that doesn't work well, I'll be further tempted to try and hack  
something together in Python... :-)

</I>
I'm sure it'll come back to you :-)

I did get past that other issue I had mentioned, which, if I recall,  
came down to some issues of ordering the startup sequence.

I've found that the Stellaris platform is much easier to write  
something and have it behave the way you expect it to, without having  
to dig through large swaths of the reference documentation for the  
hardware.  That simplicity does have a cost, in that there's way more  
flexibility with STM32, but I find it takes more time to debug, and  
that solutions are sometimes non-obvious after the fact :-)  I don't  
think I'm alone there, since I've seen plenty of discussions on the  
STM32 forums that sound similar to my own experiences.

Right now non-clocked conversion seems to work OK, and it runs at a  
similar speed to LM3S6965 with adcscope.lua.  While this chip is  
clocked faster, I think it's not bad for a first pass at settings  
things up.  Their DMA support also allows for some flexibility that,  
in some ways, I like better than the dedicated FIFOs on Luminary.  The  
DMA includes both source and destination address incrementation, and  
has separate interrupts for half-full/complete events.

I feel like their docs and/or driver model could be more friendly to  
someone who isn't intimately familiar with their peripheral  
architecture, though.  You definitely cannot write driver interfaces  
that differ much from their code examples using only the driver  
manual.  You need the chip reference manual to figure out how the  
hardware works, and then you can find the appropriate calls to set  
things up.  Certainly you have to do this, to some degree, on all  
platforms, but with Luminary's docs I got most of what I needed just  
from their driver manual, and from a few app notes.  This makes me  
wonder a bit about what things are like with other manufacturer's  
offerings :-)
