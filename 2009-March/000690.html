</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Thank you very much John.
We've been getting help and support from other users but it is still hard :(
Asko Kauppi, from Finland, will send us two kits from Atmel. Bogdan will get
his fairly easy but mine will have to be sent to Chamonix, France, from
where I have a french friend comming down to the tropics by the end of
April.
No scheme seems to work well thru the post these days, as even the &quot;no-tax
for under US$50,00 gifts&quot; law is respected here. The packages are always
opened at the post office, by customs agents and they tax us based on a
totally arbitrary evaluation of the item :( :(
The only thing I can think of now is to wait for someone comming to visit
our beaches and to enjoy our sunny weather :)
I eventually have students comming from USA but it is not that frequent.
Maybe I should organize an eLua Workshop here one of these days :)

Is it any easier if you purchase &#8220;used&#8221; equipment via the likes of eBay?
&gt;<i>
</I>It is russian roulette &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_roulette">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_roulette</A>&gt;,
sometimes it works, sometimes not. For me it has never worked :(

&gt;<i> Or if hardware is (genuinely) gifted or loaned to you?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>It should be free of taxes up to US$50,00, shipping included (which is
ridiculous) but in practise, it all depends on the customs officer mood on
the day :(
It seems to work if we complain  and open a judicial process but I still
prefer to pay the taxes than to deal with lawyers.

&gt;<i> I notice there is a far amount of used Lego Nxt equipment already available
</I>&gt;<i> on eBay.  Or it should be possible to set up some system where donations are
</I>&gt;<i> collected via Paypal and someone in the US or EU uses this to purchase
</I>&gt;<i> needed equipment and send it to you by whatever route works (loan, gift,
</I>&gt;<i> second-hand purchase, whatever). Obviously within the law, but maybe there
</I>&gt;<i> is some way round this?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Thank you very much again, for raising all these possibilities.
We now have a way to receive official donations, from individuals and from
companies, all tax-deductible but only in USA. It works thru an educational
organization/foundation where PUC-Rio is a member.
I don't have all the details yet, we've just opened this door and we hope to
deserve some funding so in the future we can work only in eLua. But we have
a long way ahead up to the eLua version 1.0 :)

I have a brother that lives in New York (for some 23 years now) and he will
come down by the end of june or before.
If we find something interesting, we could ship to his house and fill up his
bags a bit.
I am specially interested in some Futurlec Stamps, that Bogdan and some
other users have already but I'm not sure how efficient is their shipment to
USA (took some 3 weeks to deliver in Europe).

We are also starting an eLua Stamp project, that will be discussed here with
you all.
It will be an open source project too and must be easy enought to be buillt
anywhere. Again, I'm sure we will have problems getting the components
(we've just finished an &quot;eLua Demo Board&quot; for a pvt project and I had to
import everything).

Thanks again for supporting eLua !
Best
Dado
