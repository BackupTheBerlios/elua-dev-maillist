I've used UPS before, for TI samples. They did not charge us but they
charged Texas Instruments and this is one of the reasons they canceled their
sample program for Brasil :(  (well, they still do it for some special
educational aplications but the bureaucracy is so boring that I stopped
trying too).
DHL is incredibly expensive. They and FedEx seem to be checked
statistically, less than the normal post but taxes are high when we're not
lucky.

I would certainly love to come to Brazil some day, and if I am ever headed
&gt;<i> there I'd be happy to bring some baggage filled with microcontrollers :-)

Be my guest ! :)
And pls be sure this is not because of your baggage ! :)

Romania seems to be easier in terms of taxes but they have post problems too
and few representatives. Aparently, they don't pay extra taxes to get
components, which is already very good. The eLua Demo Board that we
developped is a comercial disaster, if manufactured here :)  We will do some
20~25 boards for specifical needs of some projects. This whole process
taught us a lot too, about what we must face to design and build a nice eLua
Stamp. (are you all thinking about it already right ? :)


&gt;<i> Mine took about that long as well to get to the US.  They do have more

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That is good news. I should order one already, ship to my brother's house
and wait for him to come down. Thanks !

For general use and eLua spreading, the eLua Stamp project will surely help
a lot, as we will be able to build the boards here too and eventually offer
some of them to other institutions and key developpers.
We will still need to get new kits though, to continue to port eLua to more
and more platforms.

Best
Dado
