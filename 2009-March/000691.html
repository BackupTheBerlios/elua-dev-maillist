What about FedEx, DHL or UPS?  I assume customs is still an issue, but  
perhaps these commercial carriers are less problematic?  Certainly  
they can be rather expensive, I'm not sure how their rates might  
compare with post.

I would certainly love to come to Brazil some day, and if I am ever  
headed there I'd be happy to bring some baggage filled with  
microcontrollers :-)

If there are other ways to help get hardware to Brazil or Romania, I'm  
up for it.

Mine took about that long as well to get to the US.  They do have more  
expensive shipping options which are supposed to be faster, which  
might be only a week or two.
