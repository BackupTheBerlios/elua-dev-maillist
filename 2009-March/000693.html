<PRE>&gt;<i> I was wondering if there was anything some of us could do to make it easier
</I>&gt;<i> for Dado and Bogdan to get hardware?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Thank you very much for your initiative. The situation in Romania is not as
bad as it seems to be in Brasil, taxes on hardware are much lower here. But
see below :)

&gt;<i>  Is it any easier if you purchase &#8220;used&#8221; equipment via the likes of eBay?
</I>&gt;<i> Or if hardware is (genuinely) gifted or loaned to you?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>eBay doesn't work so well in Romania. Or, in other words, there aren't many
people that ship to Romania, basically our beautiful country thrives on
hackers that constantly hack sites like eBay. We do have access to PayPal
though, so we can easily do the payments. Personally, I don't even know how
to use eBay, and the same goes for my friends (to give you an idea about its
popularity here). About the &quot;gift&quot; part, I did receive hardware for which I
did not have to pay any taxes, and there is a specific procedure for tax
exemption accepted by our customs (sometimes :) ).

&gt;<i> I notice there is a far amount of used Lego Nxt equipment already available
</I>&gt;<i> on eBay.  Or it should be possible to set up some system where donations are
</I>&gt;<i> collected via Paypal and someone in the US or EU uses this to purchase
</I>&gt;<i> needed equipment and send it to you by whatever route works (loan, gift,
</I>&gt;<i> second-hand purchase, whatever). Obviously within the law, but maybe there
</I>&gt;<i> is some way round this?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Lego NXT is a special case, in that our local Lego distributors are
basically a bunch of morons. I didn't really try looking for it somewhere
else yet. It's entirely possible to get hardware to Romania from
Asia/America, with a few constraints in mind:

- they must be willing to send to Romania (most do).
- they must have a shipping option that won't force you to pay $60 (usual
rate for DHS/FedEx from US) for shipping when you're entire order is less
than $30 :). And this is a bigger problem; sometimes companies are simply
not willing to use regular mail or other cheaper shipping options.

Best,
Bogdan
