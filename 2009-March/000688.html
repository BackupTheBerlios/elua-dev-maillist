<PRE>Hello All,
   Thank you for the presentation and for the comments Mike. It is very
important for us to know the goals and the usages of eLua users, so we can
&quot;tune&quot; the development accordingly.
   I'm glad you are already in contact with Ralph, as he is _the_ guy to
hear for the Lego NXT and for Lua Embedded in general. Don't miss his
chapter on the new Lua Programming
Gems&lt;<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Gems-Luiz-Henrique-Figueiredo/dp/8590379841">http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Gems-Luiz-Henrique-Figueiredo/dp/8590379841</A>&gt;book.
Ralph is here in the list with us too.
   We use the Lego NXT (and pbLua !) in some classes in PUC-Rio and we
decided to begin our Lego NXT eLua port (MCU is already supported) last
january. But for almost three months now we've been trying to buy one unit
for me and another one for Bogdan, without success. Unfortunately, both
Brazil and Romania have silly difficulties with customs and/or import taxes,
There are no Lego representatives down here and, although there are in
Romania, they were not capable of shipping one to Bogdan yet.
   Pls forgive us for the problems we are experiencing with the site. We
hope to get it back online very soon.

Regards
Dado

</I>&gt;<i> Hi, just want to mention that the eLua web site at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.eluaproject.net/">http://www.eluaproject.net/</A> looks to be down for at least 24 hours this
</I>&gt;<i> weekend.  Hopefully this is just a minor glitch and it will be up again
</I>&gt;<i> soon.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BTW, I'm VERY new Lua in general and eLua specifically, but in 2 days I've
</I>&gt;<i> made my way through about 2/3's of the &quot;Programming in Lua&quot; book and I'm
</I>&gt;<i> excited by what I'm learning about this sleek little language.  I'm working
</I>&gt;<i> on what I believe is an exciting project that will hopefully make it very
</I>&gt;<i> easy for kids (of all ages) to program Arm based robotic devices such as
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> LEGO NXT.   I have a 7 year old just getting into Lego NXT and I was very
</I>&gt;<i> surprised that there really aren't programming environments for this
</I>&gt;<i> otherwise exceptional learning tool geared for kids 7 to 14 in age --
</I>&gt;<i> including LEGO's own NXT-G environment which is clumsy to work with at
</I>&gt;<i> best.
</I>&gt;<i> Most NXT environments seem to be aimed at serious hobbyist with
</I>&gt;<i> professional
</I>&gt;<i> software experience.  This is fine itself, but not a realistic solution for
</I>&gt;<i> 95% of kids who just want to make robots do interesting things.  Anyway,
</I>&gt;<i> I'm
</I>&gt;<i> hoping that there is opportunity to bring innovation to this area.  Based
</I>&gt;<i> on
</I>&gt;<i> what I'm learning about Lua and eLua's ability to run on resource limited
</I>&gt;<i> devices, it could be just the ticket for implementing a substantial part of
</I>&gt;<i> the solution I hope to create.  I'll be hanging out here for a while as I
</I>&gt;<i> get running eLua running on an Olimex AT91SAM7S256 dev board I purchased
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> then eventually the NXT brick itself.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BTW, I have been in contact with Ralph Hempel, the creator of pbLua for the
</I>&gt;<i> NXT, and he provided a lot of encouragement to pursue Lua for my project.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sure pbLua will factor somehow into what I'm doing, but for now I want
</I>&gt;<i> to get a bottoms-up education on running Lua as close to the metal as I
</I>&gt;<i> can.
</I>&gt;<i> Working with eLua at the source code level seems like a good place to
</I>&gt;<i> begin.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to thank the eLua creators and community for creating a
</I>&gt;<i> wonderful resource that others can piggy back on top of.
