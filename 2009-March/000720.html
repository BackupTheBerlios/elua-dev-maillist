</I>
True.  Language preference always seems to come down to a personal thing
anyway. :)  As far as being a general purpose tool, make sucks.  Its not
even a very pretty language, but it gets the job done.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That makes (no pun intended??) sense.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As for not being able to do something with make that you can do with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sconstruct, I highly doubt its due to any lacking features of make.  Its
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more likely due to the level of familiarity you have with make vs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> python/scons.  If make were as inflexible as you say, I highly doubt a build
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as complex as the Linux kernel would use it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't recall ever saying that make is inflexible. If I did, I have to
</I>&gt;<i> apologize, because I find make one of the most flexible tools I ever
</I>&gt;<i> encountered. But its flexibility comes at the price of expresivity and user
</I>&gt;<i> friendliness (or, in other words, the sheer beauty of the language :) ) IMO.
</I>&gt;<i> A price that some people (me included) aren't willing to pay unless they
</I>&gt;<i> absolutely have to. If we were to follow the same principle in programming,
</I>&gt;<i> we'd probably have to use C and nothing else, since it's such a flexible
</I>&gt;<i> language. In the end, everybody needs to find his own balance and decide on
</I>&gt;<i> the tool he finds most suitable for his own needs and preferences. It's
</I>&gt;<i> always good to be able to make a choice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Make is flexible, but ugly as hell. ;)  I would never use it as a general
purpose thing (I don't think you even could, there are some things make
can't do, like math IIRC) but it is good for what it was designed for.  I am
not saying that you can't or should not use other languages to do build
tasks.  I am however saying that using a language that was designed for it
is probably better then (more efficient than?) shoehorning another language
in to doing the task.  The fact that the scons package had to be developed
to do something that is intrinsic to make is kind of proof of this IMO.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For instance, scons seems to lack good support for directory recursion,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and directory level build rules, unless you hack on it quite a bit. I once
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rewrote the eLua build system to factor out all the build rules into
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> separate sconstruct files (I *HATE* long file lists with directory garbage
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in them), it was an immense task that could have been done extremely simply
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in make.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think you can do that simpler in scons too, but I might be wrong. I do
</I>&gt;<i> recall some quite simple scons scripts that dealt with recurssion somewhere
</I>&gt;<i> in the internet :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
In this case I guess what I mean by simple was I would not have had to look
it up in a manual to do it with make...  Also, IIRC PWD/CWD issues are
handled differently by scons/python vs make, which kind of confused me at
first, but made sense when I started thinking of scons in terms of a single
python process executing from project root, vs the way you normally do
things in make.

The main reason for the frustration was that in make based build systems
(usually, not always) you can just 'cd' into part of the project tree and
run a make there to (re)make just that part of the tree (say if you were
editing files in that directory or whatever and you wanted to run a build
test). With scons, as far as I know, there is no way to replicate this
behaviour.  You have no choice but to run the entire build from the project
root dir.  Please correct me if I am wrong here!


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have in the past spent enough time as a build manager of large projects
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to realize that there truly is nothing as powerful as make in existence.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's the kind of statement that I generally find &quot;too absolute&quot; to be
</I>&gt;<i> reasonable, but maybe you have indeed a vast experience with _lots_ of
</I>&gt;<i> different build systems and tools. I only tried make combined with
</I>&gt;<i> automake/autoconf (and I completely dislike them for the same reasons I
</I>&gt;<i> dislike make), cmake (just a quick sip), some strange system based on DOS
</I>&gt;<i> batch files :), and that's it (with the exception of scons, obviously).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It is kind of absolute I guess.  I have used scons in this project, and had
exposure to it from a few other things, but never really had to *use*
(maintain its use) except with eLua.  I have designed some ruby modules,
they sort of have their own build system, but its main purpose is to manage
the construction of makefiles, so they technically use make.  I have used a
custom lisp based makefile management system, but again it used make on the
backend.  Most of the stuff I had to manage used autoconf/automake, which
again is really just a makefile management system... Hmm even the buildroot
based embedded stuff I had to integrate with/manage used make....  I guess I
have been exposed to quite a bit of software that needed to be built, but
most of it used make at some point!  I have never really thought about it
until now!

Actually now that I think of it, are there really any build tools out there
other then scons and derivatives that *don't* use make at some point??  I
can't think of any off hand, but most of the software I build is either
something I manage so uses make or a make manager, or foss/gnu type software
which mostly uses autoconf....


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You might want to pair something with it, like automake/autoconf or rubys
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> make file generating tools, but I have yet to find a tool as simple (and as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> small!) as make.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Lua ? (I know, I know, I'm just being mean here :) ). I won't argue with
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;small&quot; part, but &quot;small&quot; is simply not something I'm after in a build
</I>&gt;<i> tool.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Hmm, now I do find that interesting.  The point of a build tool (IMO) is to
make it easy to build software.  This does not necessarily mean make it easy
to write the build scripts, but it does mean that a piece of software should
*just build* when you unpack it.  As a software developer, there has been
quite a bit of things that I wanted to play with but never have because they
did not compile *out of the box*.  I'm not talking about having to resolve
dependencies due to external libs or whatever, I mean if I have to mess with
the build system to get a piece of software I just want to use to even
build, then its probably not worth my time.  For the most part, software
that uses make as a build system *just builds*.  I can't say that for
anything else, because for things like scons, you would (for the most part)
have to go download scons, and maybe even python, and maybe (at an extreme)
build them, before you can even build the scons managed code!  Thats quite a
bit of work just to do a task you will more then likely only do once (build
the software then install it).  This is why small in a build system is good.
:<i>)
</I>
Think of all the people that don't have a fast connection that have to
download a tool that may take many minutes to download and only a few to
use.  I would figure that being a person in a country where its hard to get
hardware shipped/sourced you of all people would appreciate that.  Imagine
if we made people buy a hardware dongle (download a special build software)
to do eLua development.  Now quite a few of the people that want to do the
development are in countries where buying and shipping the hardware is very
difficult (slow network connection).  That may be a bad analogy, but I think
it fits to explain where I am coming from with my idea of build systems...


&gt;<i> Please understand that I'm not trying to convince you that make is a bad
</I>&gt;<i> tool, because I don't believe that. I'm just answering to your &quot;why do you
</I>&gt;<i> hate make&quot; question. And I'm stating this because I don't want to start yet
</I>&gt;<i> another religious war, although it would be a first for our mailing list :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Hmm, a religious war around make would indeed be an odd one, esp for a first
on a list. ;)  Sorry if it seems like I am trying to start one, as I am
not.  I just never have understood the want of some to apply a large and
generic tool to the job of a very specific and seldom used problem domain.
Especially when there already exists a universally available and
specifically designed tool for the job.  Thats an issue with me, not anyone
else. :)


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best,
</I>&gt;<i> Bogdan
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PS. Hmmm ... sounds to me like you'd like to contribute a make-based build
</I>&gt;<i> system to eLua ? :D
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I could if you really wanted.  I could even make it fancy with a graphical
configuration tool like the Linux kernel has (in fact it would be the same
tool).  In one way that would be nice to have as it seperates platform
configuration out of the code, but I don't think eLua is big enough to
actually *need* that feature right now.

Thanks for the great debate :),
Mike
