<PRE>FYI: CuteCom is basically like Bray's terminal, if you've used it on  
windows.  It doesn't really handle terminal characters, so anything  
that's drawing text on the screen with term isn't going to work  
correctly.

Oh well :-)

</I>&gt;<i> I've tried a few things including minicom, and haven't been thrilled

</I>&gt;<i> yet is CuteCom (<A HREF="http://cutecom.sourceforge.net/">http://cutecom.sourceforge.net/</A>).  I'm going to try  
</I>&gt;<i> and compile that on my Mac, it looks like it's at least in the  
</I>&gt;<i> Ubuntu repositories though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If that doesn't work well, I'll be further tempted to try and hack  
</I>&gt;<i> something together in Python... :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> FYI: I have an ADC implementation for STM32 that should basically  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> work, but something is causing a hang on boot when I enable the ADC  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> peripheral clock on boot.  I'll commit that and some changes to  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> elua_adc that allow it to handle situations where a single  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interrupt gives you values from a series of channels.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Good news, keep up the good work! After all the docs I wrote (and  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm still writing) I'm not even sure I know how to program anymore :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sure it'll come back to you :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I did get past that other issue I had mentioned, which, if I recall,  
</I>&gt;<i> came down to some issues of ordering the startup sequence.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've found that the Stellaris platform is much easier to write  
</I>&gt;<i> something and have it behave the way you expect it to, without  
</I>&gt;<i> having to dig through large swaths of the reference documentation  
</I>&gt;<i> for the hardware.  That simplicity does have a cost, in that there's  
</I>&gt;<i> way more flexibility with STM32, but I find it takes more time to  
</I>&gt;<i> debug, and that solutions are sometimes non-obvious after the  
</I>&gt;<i> fact :-)  I don't think I'm alone there, since I've seen plenty of  
</I>&gt;<i> discussions on the STM32 forums that sound similar to my own  
</I>&gt;<i> experiences.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right now non-clocked conversion seems to work OK, and it runs at a  
</I>&gt;<i> similar speed to LM3S6965 with adcscope.lua.  While this chip is  
</I>&gt;<i> clocked faster, I think it's not bad for a first pass at settings  
</I>&gt;<i> things up.  Their DMA support also allows for some flexibility that,  
</I>&gt;<i> in some ways, I like better than the dedicated FIFOs on Luminary.   
</I>&gt;<i> The DMA includes both source and destination address incrementation,  
</I>&gt;<i> and has separate interrupts for half-full/complete events.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I feel like their docs and/or driver model could be more friendly to  
</I>&gt;<i> someone who isn't intimately familiar with their peripheral  
</I>&gt;<i> architecture, though.  You definitely cannot write driver interfaces  
</I>&gt;<i> that differ much from their code examples using only the driver  
</I>&gt;<i> manual.  You need the chip reference manual to figure out how the  
</I>&gt;<i> hardware works, and then you can find the appropriate calls to set  
</I>&gt;<i> things up.  Certainly you have to do this, to some degree, on all  
</I>&gt;<i> platforms, but with Luminary's docs I got most of what I needed just  
</I>&gt;<i> from their driver manual, and from a few app notes.  This makes me  
</I>&gt;<i> wonder a bit about what things are like with other manufacturer's  
</I>&gt;<i> offerings :-)
