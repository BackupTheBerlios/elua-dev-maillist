Right, and it could be traded for functionality on space-impaired  
platforms.

I'm not sure how large this would end up being if it were really kept  
as simple as possible, but space is always at a premium :-)

&gt;<i>    We also want to concentrate the doc in a single place and the  
</I>&gt;<i> move we've made (comming on v0.6) to webbook proves that. But not  
</I>&gt;<i> all the project's &quot;doc&quot; is related to the modules, their functions  
</I>&gt;<i> or even the code implementation. This would be more of a &quot;Reference  
</I>&gt;<i> Manual&quot;, which is one of the sections of the new &quot;site/doc&quot;.
</I>
This is true.  What I was thinking of was less something that would  
regenerate the docs from scratch and more something that would parse  
documentation strings in the code and the HTML in the docs and update  
text sections in the HTML they didn't match the code.  This way could  
could selectively slave parts of the HTML documentation contents off  
of descriptions in the code.

I suppose something like this could also run the other way.  If the  
reference manual HTML is regularized enough, you could scrape the  
module documentation from the html and generate some sort of packed  
doc that could live in romfs or on an SD card, and then you could get  
your documentation from there.  This might be the easiest solution and  
keeps the webbook docs as the master.
