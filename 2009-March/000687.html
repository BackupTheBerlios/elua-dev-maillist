<PRE>
Hi, just want to mention that the eLua web site at
<A HREF="http://www.eluaproject.net/">http://www.eluaproject.net/</A> looks to be down for at least 24 hours this
weekend.  Hopefully this is just a minor glitch and it will be up again
soon.

BTW, I'm VERY new Lua in general and eLua specifically, but in 2 days I've
made my way through about 2/3's of the &quot;Programming in Lua&quot; book and I'm
excited by what I'm learning about this sleek little language.  I'm working
on what I believe is an exciting project that will hopefully make it very
easy for kids (of all ages) to program Arm based robotic devices such as the
LEGO NXT.   I have a 7 year old just getting into Lego NXT and I was very
surprised that there really aren't programming environments for this
otherwise exceptional learning tool geared for kids 7 to 14 in age --
including LEGO's own NXT-G environment which is clumsy to work with at best. 
Most NXT environments seem to be aimed at serious hobbyist with professional
software experience.  This is fine itself, but not a realistic solution for
95% of kids who just want to make robots do interesting things.  Anyway, I'm
hoping that there is opportunity to bring innovation to this area.  Based on
what I'm learning about Lua and eLua's ability to run on resource limited
devices, it could be just the ticket for implementing a substantial part of
the solution I hope to create.  I'll be hanging out here for a while as I
get running eLua running on an Olimex AT91SAM7S256 dev board I purchased and
then eventually the NXT brick itself.

BTW, I have been in contact with Ralph Hempel, the creator of pbLua for the
NXT, and he provided a lot of encouragement to pursue Lua for my project. 
I'm sure pbLua will factor somehow into what I'm doing, but for now I want
to get a bottoms-up education on running Lua as close to the metal as I can. 
Working with eLua at the source code level seems like a good place to begin.

I would like to thank the eLua creators and community for creating a
wonderful resource that others can piggy back on top of.
