What I mean here are the cases where you have everything little endian  
except for the floats where the first four bytes are flipped with the  
last four bytes.  That's what I'm getting the impression may be  
toolchain based.

I'm thinking of the arm_float option provided by the cross compiler.   
In the updated docs you mention using arm_float for a non-EABI  
toolchain, and just float for an EABI toolchain.

</I>
Hmm... I don't have one unfortunately... maybe what I should do is get  
an emulator going with PowerPC or something similar running Linux and  
at least test things there to make sure that stuff gets negotiated  
properly.

It currently is set up to use the native format for both ends (if  
they're the same), and default to network order (big endian) if they  
differ.  I think this should be a reasonable compromise for speed  
(though with the current implementation I'm not sure how much of a  
speed hit is incurred by flipping everything).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It looks like, from the beta docs, that it simply depends on whether  
</I>&gt;<i> or not one is using an EABI or non-EABI compiler toolchain.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Big or little endian have nothing to do with the toolchain. All the

</I>&gt;<i> without problems, all you need to do is give the compiler/linker/ 
</I>&gt;<i> assembler the correct options.
</I>
I suppose I should check compiling with these options too.  That might  
be one way to try big-endian on ARM.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm thinking that it would be nice to do something like the  
</I>&gt;<i> following for float enabled cases:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. set some float to a particular value
</I>&gt;<i> 2. use a union or cast to look at the individual bytes and determine  
</I>&gt;<i> what pattern it might match.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You don't even need a float, the test is actually easier to  
</I>&gt;<i> implement with integers:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> int is_big_endian()
</I>&gt;<i> {
</I>&gt;<i>   u32 test = 0x12345678;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   return *( ( u8 * )&amp;test ) == 0x12;
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>
Currently I'm just using the same test Lua does on an int:

int test=1;
  target.little_endian=*(char*)&test;

I suppose this works so long as int isn't only a single byte (or some  
other weird ordering can confuse it).

Perhaps some efficient byte swapping and configuration checking  
functions would be good to have in the general toolchest of functions  
on eLua?

It looks like on ARM platforms there are some fairly efficient ways to  
do this in the instruction set (not sure if this is exposed in C):
<A HREF="http://www.doulos.com/knowhow/arm/Hints_and_Tips/Byte_Swapping/">http://www.doulos.com/knowhow/arm/Hints_and_Tips/Byte_Swapping/</A>

I'm not that worried about speed, and it's probably the last thing  
I'll touch, but as with everything else, I prefer to leave as much  
time for the VM as possible, rather than wasting cycles on mundane  
stuff like byte swapping.  I also figure this sort of thing might  
actually matter on faster links.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Certainly there could also be some defines or something else to clue  
</I>&gt;<i> things in at compile time, but autodetection would be nice in the  
</I>&gt;<i> sense that it isn't dependent on the compiler defining something to  
</I>&gt;<i> clue the code in.  I'm not sure if there's fragility built into such  
</I>&gt;<i> an approach though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Autodetection is so easy to do that you don't need any other macros.  
</I>&gt;<i> At least at runtime. Of course, if you're doing conditional  
</I>&gt;<i> compilation, you will need some macro to tell you if you're  
</I>&gt;<i> compiling for little or big endian.
</I>
Right, I figure that this is actually more cross-compiler friendly as  
well.  Since if integer or floating point representations don't match  
some pre-defined pattern anyways, they're going to require some  
additional mangling to get things to communicate anyways.
