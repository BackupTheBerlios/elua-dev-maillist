<PRE>Thank you Louie,
   The truth, and I think you made it very clear in your message, is that
that chips are made to profitable targeted applications and not to fullfill
our dreams on a general-purpose complete and cheap platform.

Best
Dado

</I>&gt;<i> Microchip makes lovely 6- and 8- pin chips ideal for embedding in, for

</I>&gt;<i> You are up to 16 pin devices before that starts to appear. In the ARM

</I>&gt;<i> In the embedded space, parts get built to support specific (hopefully

</I>&gt;<i> number of on-chip peripherals, or lots of memory, etc.  In a previous
</I>&gt;<i> professional gig, we built VoIP devices that shipped in moderate volume
</I>&gt;<i> (1M-2M units/year).  This is a nice &quot;sweet spot&quot; for a part manufacturer who
</I>&gt;<i> would build a device targeted to that application which also happens to be
</I>&gt;<i> price sensitive.  You don't want to ship parts out with unused peripherals
</I>&gt;<i> or lots of extra memory because an extra $2 of cost per unit turns into a
</I>&gt;<i> pretty noticeable numbers at 1,000,000 units shipped.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you're only talking about building a few hundred units, then the extra
</I>&gt;<i> cost isn't really as much of a consideration, especially when you might be
</I>&gt;<i> able to reduce the one-time engineering expense by optimizing time spent vs.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;extra&quot; hardware.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think that Marvell is building some interesting  higher-end parts, with
