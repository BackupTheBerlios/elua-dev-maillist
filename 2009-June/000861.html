</I>huahehae :) I'm sorry John !!! Pls (you all) orgive my poor english, not
only for silly typing errors like this but for the general ideas. I'm not
sure if I was clear enough about this topic, that I consider an important
and delicate one at this moment and I'll try to make myself more clear next
time :)


&gt;<i>  My posting was more born of frustration that the ARM microcontroller

</I>&gt;<i> machine capable of handling the entire requirement!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This is not the impression I have from here.  Although I would also like to
have much (and cheaper) more boards available for eLua, specially with some
more internal memory, I have the impression they are comming pretty fast
now.

&gt;<i>  It continues to baffle me that the industry does not get the market for
</I>&gt;<i> high-functionality, highly integrated, low pin-count devices &#8211; this seems so
</I>&gt;<i> obvious for intelligent sensors and actuators.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yes, this is strange and also the trend to include now the high-end
peripherals in the same families, like video/audio stream processors. It
would certainly be nice for us to see it going in the other direction, the
one you mention, low pin-count devices, easy to use (DIP, ....) and cheap.

&gt;<i> Even in the 8-bit field, Microchip makes lovely 6- and 8- pin chips ideal
</I>&gt;<i> for embedding in, for example, a single limit switch, but they have no
</I>&gt;<i> serial comms capability! You are up to 16 pin devices before that starts to
</I>&gt;<i> appear. In the ARM market, large on-chip memory seems to go hand in hand
</I>&gt;<i> with high pin-count and therefore complex and expensive packages and PCBs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, very true :)
But let's keep our eyes open. The market will never be formed arround a
single chip but arround many diferent options. That's why we want eLua to be
so portable.
Meanwhile, we'll keep looking for a good candidate for our first eLua Stamp
(I propose to start this thread immediately :) and hearing the findings of
our members. Snyder had found a while ago a neat little cute board from
England (I guess) but we've had no news since.

&gt;<i>  Are the boards you are working on network capable?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yes, PNY included.
If everything goes well, we may have 5 working withing 2~3 weeks.

Abra&#231;ossssssssssssss

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i>    The boundaries between a gronwup embedded environment and a linux box
</I>&gt;<i> are indeed pretty vague these days. This is one of the reasons we don't have
</I>&gt;<i> a clear choice for our first eLua Stamp yet. I am personally confused with
</I>&gt;<i> the linux box solutions trend and feel bad for not having too much time to
</I>&gt;<i> keep an eye on this.
</I>&gt;<i>    But I don't think a X86 platform, enhanced with some more I/O capability
</I>&gt;<i> and running Lua with peripheral handling extensions will be the best answer
</I>&gt;<i> for the typical dedicated hardware platforms we all dream of, although it
</I>&gt;<i> can certainly have it's place too.
</I>&gt;<i>    Development boards/platforms are indeed expensive, because they sell in
</I>&gt;<i> relative low quantities. But it is not too hard to build a nice board for
</I>&gt;<i> eLua in for under US$ 50, in 10~50 quantities. We are actually buiding an
</I>&gt;<i> eLua board for some specific projects downhere, arround an LPC, with 8Mb
</I>&gt;<i> external RAM, 512Kb flash and it would come out about this prices, if we
</I>&gt;<i> have not to build it in a country like Brazil, where import taxes are a joke
</I>&gt;<i> and PCB building costs are abusive. I am pretty sure that later this year,
</I>&gt;<i> with the help of you guys, we will be able to come up with a nice and cheap
</I>&gt;<i> eLua Stamp that fits well in our pockets :)0
</I>&gt;<i>    Our motivations for eLua maybe somewhat different from the view of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;let's embedd Lua on the best cost x benefit platform on the market&quot;. What
</I>&gt;<i> we see in the field instrumentation area (downhere) is that the hardware is
</I>&gt;<i> becoming more &quot;inteligent&quot;, moving from 8 bit platforms (that still dominate
</I>&gt;<i> 82% of the market, according to Jack Ganssle) straight to 32 bits or to
</I>&gt;<i> hibrid architectures, where the 8 bit devices become &quot;satelites&quot; of a
</I>&gt;<i> central and more powerfull (32 bit) controller.
</I>&gt;<i>    This scenario clearly asks for better software tools and specially for
</I>&gt;<i> better development environments, where the final user, application/process
</I>&gt;<i> engineers and sensor technitians can program more functionality in their
</I>&gt;<i> products without the need of years of experience in Desktop-based
</I>&gt;<i> development, C/Asm languages etc....  To offer something powerfull and
</I>&gt;<i> simple as Lua, with peripheral handling libs/extensions/modules not only for
</I>&gt;<i> the peripheral world devices (ie: spi, uart, ad/da, ...) but for final
</I>&gt;<i> project &quot;parts&quot; (ie: gps, displays, kbds, ...), with no need for a PC-based
</I>&gt;<i> development for the upper &quot;layers&quot; of the aplications seems to be a nice
</I>&gt;<i> goal too.
</I>&gt;<i>     I think the X86 architecture will always be a strong &quot;market force&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> although many low end netbooks (and that's what netbooks are, low end
</I>&gt;<i> laptops :) are also tasting ARM, for still lower prices and sizes. Linux
</I>&gt;<i> fits well on them all and may very acomodate Lua with embedded extensions to
</I>&gt;<i> offer what eLua wants to offer otherwise. But imho, the dedicated
</I>&gt;<i> sensor/instrumentation/appliance dedicated controllers will not be replaced
</I>&gt;<i> by these generic and customized linux-box based solutions, even considering
</I>&gt;<i> their price drop.
</I>&gt;<i>    Also, both solutions can coexist very well, leaving the pc-based and
</I>&gt;<i> software-expert development with the linux boxes and final-user and
</I>&gt;<i> process/product professionals with eLua.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best

</I>&gt;<i> When I subscribed to this list half a year ago I confidently expected to be

</I>&gt;<i> many such chips in a seriously distributed architecture with the processing
</I>&gt;<i> kept near to the IO to simplify wiring. To avoid buying an endless
</I>&gt;<i> succession of development boards I set a simple threshold specification of
</I>&gt;<i> 512K on-chip flash, 64K on-chip RAM, Ethernet capability (I was prepared to
</I>&gt;<i> compromise with a second chip for this). With this type of distributed
</I>&gt;<i> architecture, I need lots of IO versatility (analog, PWM, UART, I2C, SPI,
</I>&gt;<i> counters etc.) but multiplexed on relatively few pins since if you run out
</I>&gt;<i> of IO you just add another chip. It should therefore be possible to have a
</I>&gt;<i> simple 20-40 pin package which could be available in hand-solderable form.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is very disappointing that after many months still the only chip that
</I>&gt;<i> comes near is the LPC2888 which seems to be buggy and expensive (the very
</I>&gt;<i> minimalist LPC-H2888 prototype board is over $150). Looking at the
</I>&gt;<i> schematics for this board really reinforced my intuition about the
</I>&gt;<i> importance of on-chip memory &#8211; a ridiculous number of pins (and therefore
</I>&gt;<i> PCB traces) is wasted on the external memory interface. And the economics
</I>&gt;<i> are terrible - for just $20 more, you can get the new Acer Aspire Revo R3600
</I>&gt;<i> nettop (in Linux rather than Vista trim). The latter has both wired and
</I>&gt;<i> wireless networking, 1GB RAM and an 8GB SSD!

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> IO is the problem of course with an X86 platform. However in my research I
</I>&gt;<i> found this incredibly poorly marketed chip:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A versatile USB to IO pins chip for only $8! This looks like great
</I>&gt;<i> universal IO problem solver. Unlike most other DIY USB solutions I&#8217;ve seen
</I>&gt;<i> which require a driver and/or serial port emulator, this is HID based and
</I>&gt;<i> therefore driverless on all major OS&#8217;s. I have ordered some of these chips
</I>&gt;<i> and will report back how it goes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am beginning to think it might just be better to cooperate with market
</I>&gt;<i> forces here since I suspect that X86 computing is going to keep widening the
</I>&gt;<i> functionality gap and reducing the price gap. Rather than trying to squeeze
</I>&gt;<i> Lua onto a cramped chip with no operating system, would it maybe be better
</I>&gt;<i> to produce a custom cut-down Linux distro with Lua built in (and perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> acting as the shell)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What do others think? Will there be cheap, single chip ARM devices meeting
