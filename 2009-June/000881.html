<PRE>&gt;<i> If you are looking for &gt;=64K SRAM, &gt;=256K flash, there are many choices.
</I>&gt;<i> Even at &gt;=96K SRAM, &gt;=512K flash, there are quite a few choices.  I'd say
</I>&gt;<i> the most interesting candidates for an eLua stamp right now are the UC3
</I>&gt;<i> (since it has 128K SRAM, external memory interfaces,  and HS USB) or the
</I>&gt;<i> Stellaris 9B (if it's available soon -- the $99 dev kits are in stock --
</I>&gt;<i> since it has 96K SRAM, Ethernet, USB, external memory interfaces, and cool
</I>&gt;<i> peripherals like PWM and quadrature encoders).
</I>

I'd like to add the STR912FAW44 from ST. Very nice chip, can be found in
LQFP package (albeit with a smaller pitch than the &quot;usual&quot; LQFPs, still much
easier to use than a BGA variant), 512k of Flash, 96K of SRAM, ARM9 at 96MHz
(ARM9 is very rare on the microcontroller market, and 96MHz is very nice),
external memory interface, and we already have a port for it :)  $15 at
Mouser in small quantities:

Kinda hard to beat this. 96k of SRAM is not 128K, but still is more than 64K
:<i>), and one can do lots of stuff in 96k. Plus, adding a small external SRAM
</I>shouldn't be difficult, anyway (it can also do PSRAM, but it seems that
PSRAM only comes in BGA packages, so I'd stick with SRAM). It has other
interesting features, like a very neat way to assign peripheral signals to
actual pins. And, unlike the AT91SAM7X512, I could actually _get_ this chip
right now :) It could be the base for something like an eLua powered
Arduino. I'm not a PCB designer (well, I designed a few boards, but they
were all very simple) but I bet a PCB designer could come up a very nice
board around this chip, and one that could be easily accesible to a
hobbyist.
Of course, the Stellaris 9B is also a very nice alternative to consider.
Even the STM32F103 from ST:

Cortex-M3 with only 64k of internal SRAM, but also with an external (P)SRAM
capable memory bus.

Best,
Bogdan
