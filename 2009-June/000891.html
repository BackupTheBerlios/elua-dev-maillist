</I>
You could use a Schmart board - and if you only want to do one board, that
might be the best way.  However, I would do a custom PCB - 2 layer should be
fine.  Getting a single PCB done is still expensive; if the board is small
and you only want one, Batch PCB seems like the best option; if the board is
larger or you want multiple boards, there are better options.  For 4 layer
boards, I'd highly recommend Sierra Proto Express, but for a design without
external memory, 2 layers should be enough.

To give you an idea of pricing, Batch PCB is a straight $2.50 USD per square
inch; at Proto Express, pricing in small quantities doesn't vary much with
size (for &lt; 30 square inches), and is about $85 for one 2-layer PCB, and
$110 total for 3 PCBs -- so it doesn't make sense to buy less than 3 PCBs
from them.  Pricing at most other fab houses is similar -- multiple boards
are a much better value than one.

BTW, at least in the US, low volume (&lt;25) assembly is quite pricey; it'll
cost more than the components.  That's why there are laser-cut stencils and
toaster ovens (Sparkfun has some great resources on designing and assembling
PCBs).

Bogdan -- yes, the STR9 line is still interesting.  I put the Stellaris 9B
in front of it because I like IEEE-1588, PWMs and QEPs, although we'll have
to see about price and availability.  I'm hoping price will be lower now
that they're part of TI.

In some ways I think the UC3 (with high speed USB 2.0 and 128K SRAM) would
make a better BASIC-Stamp competitor than a SAM7X512/STR911FAW/9B96 with
Ethernet and USB.  But those of who like particular chips need to get some
PCBs designed (unfortunately I'm still tied up for a while with family
matters and a lot of CANOpen stuff, although I should be able to help
getting PCBs made).
