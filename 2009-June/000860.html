<PRE>Hi Dado, you had me googling &quot;gronwup embedded environment&quot; before realising
it was a typo!

 

My posting was more born of frustration that the ARM microcontroller
industry seems to have advanced so little in the last six months compared to
the rate the X86 market moves on. I was really hoping someone would point me
at some hope the next six months would bring me what I was looking for. I do
not want to give up on distributed processing architectures yet, but it is
hard when just one processing node ends up nearly as expensive as a central
machine capable of handling the entire requirement!

 

It continues to baffle me that the industry does not get the market for
high-functionality, highly integrated, low pin-count devices - this seems so
obvious for intelligent sensors and actuators. Even in the 8-bit field,
Microchip makes lovely 6- and 8- pin chips ideal for embedding in, for
example, a single limit switch, but they have no serial comms capability!
You are up to 16 pin devices before that starts to appear. In the ARM
market, large on-chip memory seems to go hand in hand with high pin-count
and therefore complex and expensive packages and PCBs. 

 

Are the boards you are working on network capable?

Subject: Re: [eLua-dev] Single Chip Lua Prospects

 

Hello,
   The boundaries between a gronwup embedded environment and a linux box are
indeed pretty vague these days. This is one of the reasons we don't have a
clear choice for our first eLua Stamp yet. I am personally confused with the
linux box solutions trend and feel bad for not having too much time to keep
an eye on this.
   But I don't think a X86 platform, enhanced with some more I/O capability
and running Lua with peripheral handling extensions will be the best answer
for the typical dedicated hardware platforms we all dream of, although it
can certainly have it's place too.
   Development boards/platforms are indeed expensive, because they sell in
relative low quantities. But it is not too hard to build a nice board for
eLua in for under US$ 50, in 10~50 quantities. We are actually buiding an
eLua board for some specific projects downhere, arround an LPC, with 8Mb
external RAM, 512Kb flash and it would come out about this prices, if we
have not to build it in a country like Brazil, where import taxes are a joke
and PCB building costs are abusive. I am pretty sure that later this year,
with the help of you guys, we will be able to come up with a nice and cheap
eLua Stamp that fits well in our pockets :)0
   Our motivations for eLua maybe somewhat different from the view of &quot;let's
embedd Lua on the best cost x benefit platform on the market&quot;. What we see
in the field instrumentation area (downhere) is that the hardware is
becoming more &quot;inteligent&quot;, moving from 8 bit platforms (that still dominate
82% of the market, according to Jack Ganssle) straight to 32 bits or to
hibrid architectures, where the 8 bit devices become &quot;satelites&quot; of a
central and more powerfull (32 bit) controller.
   This scenario clearly asks for better software tools and specially for
better development environments, where the final user, application/process
engineers and sensor technitians can program more functionality in their
products without the need of years of experience in Desktop-based
development, C/Asm languages etc....  To offer something powerfull and
simple as Lua, with peripheral handling libs/extensions/modules not only for
the peripheral world devices (ie: spi, uart, ad/da, ...) but for final
project &quot;parts&quot; (ie: gps, displays, kbds, ...), with no need for a PC-based
development for the upper &quot;layers&quot; of the aplications seems to be a nice
goal too.
    I think the X86 architecture will always be a strong &quot;market force&quot;,
although many low end netbooks (and that's what netbooks are, low end
laptops :) are also tasting ARM, for still lower prices and sizes. Linux
fits well on them all and may very acomodate Lua with embedded extensions to
offer what eLua wants to offer otherwise. But imho, the dedicated
sensor/instrumentation/appliance dedicated controllers will not be replaced
by these generic and customized linux-box based solutions, even considering
their price drop.
   Also, both solutions can coexist very well, leaving the pc-based and
software-expert development with the linux boxes and final-user and
process/product professionals with eLua.

Best
Dado

When I subscribed to this list half a year ago I confidently expected to be
able to use a single chip Lua device in my projects by now. I wanted to use
many such chips in a seriously distributed architecture with the processing
kept near to the IO to simplify wiring. To avoid buying an endless
succession of development boards I set a simple threshold specification of
512K on-chip flash, 64K on-chip RAM, Ethernet capability (I was prepared to
compromise with a second chip for this). With this type of distributed
architecture, I need lots of IO versatility (analog, PWM, UART, I2C, SPI,
counters etc.) but multiplexed on relatively few pins since if you run out
of IO you just add another chip. It should therefore be possible to have a
simple 20-40 pin package which could be available in hand-solderable form.

 

It is very disappointing that after many months still the only chip that
comes near is the LPC2888 which seems to be buggy and expensive (the very
minimalist LPC-H2888 prototype board is over $150). Looking at the
schematics for this board really reinforced my intuition about the
importance of on-chip memory - a ridiculous number of pins (and therefore
PCB traces) is wasted on the external memory interface. And the economics
are terrible - for just $20 more, you can get the new Acer Aspire Revo R3600
nettop (in Linux rather than Vista trim). The latter has both wired and
wireless networking, 1GB RAM and an 8GB SSD!

 

IO is the problem of course with an X86 platform. However in my research I
found this incredibly poorly marketed chip:

 

<A HREF="http://delcomproduct.com/products_USBIO.asp#DemoBrd">http://delcomproduct.com/products_USBIO.asp#DemoBrd</A>

 

A versatile USB to IO pins chip for only $8! This looks like great universal
IO problem solver. Unlike most other DIY USB solutions I've seen which
require a driver and/or serial port emulator, this is HID based and
therefore driverless on all major OS's. I have ordered some of these chips
and will report back how it goes.

 

I am beginning to think it might just be better to cooperate with market
forces here since I suspect that X86 computing is going to keep widening the
functionality gap and reducing the price gap. Rather than trying to squeeze
Lua onto a cramped chip with no operating system, would it maybe be better
to produce a custom cut-down Linux distro with Lua built in (and perhaps
acting as the shell)?

 

What do others think? Will there be cheap, single chip ARM devices meeting
my spec available in the next few months?
