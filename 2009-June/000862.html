In the embedded space, parts get built to support specific (hopefully  
volume) applications.  This is why you might not see parts with a  
large number of on-chip peripherals, or lots of memory, etc.  In a  
previous professional gig, we built VoIP devices that shipped in  
moderate volume (1M-2M units/year).  This is a nice &quot;sweet spot&quot; for a  
part manufacturer who would build a device targeted to that  
application which also happens to be price sensitive.  You don't want  
to ship parts out with unused peripherals or lots of extra memory  
because an extra $2 of cost per unit turns into a pretty noticeable  
numbers at 1,000,000 units shipped.

If you're only talking about building a few hundred units, then the  
extra cost isn't really as much of a consideration, especially when  
you might be able to reduce the one-time engineering expense by  
optimizing time spent vs. &quot;extra&quot; hardware.

I think that Marvell is building some interesting  higher-end parts,  
with perhaps a lack of GPIO I/O, A/D, etc. capability but with  
networking, etc.  Otherwise, you're looking to repurpose devices built  
for some targeted applications.
