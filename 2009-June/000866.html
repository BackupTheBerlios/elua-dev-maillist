<PRE>This is true, however I think the non-custom parts actually go a  
pretty good distance towards what we're after.  Many of the chips on  
these devel boards are kind-of &quot;kitchen sink&quot; chips that have way more  
peripherals than are needed for any one single application.

It seems like the problem is that we're asking for something that's  
even a bit more general, but not that much more.  Since these general  
parts already have most of the stuff we need and they're still not  
much more than $10 by themselves, I think we should be able to find  
something that meets a reasonable minimum set of peripherals, and,  
maybe, requires one or two added external chips at the max.

It might be a good idea to start by speccing out some sort of common  
set of peripheral needs that would be satisfactory for a Lua stamp,  
and then go from there?

Here's what I, personally, would like:
- somewhere near 40 pins out, most/all of which can be used for GPIO,  
or configured for various peripherals
- output pins are dip, compatible with standard-sized breadboards
- 8+ A/D channels (10-bit, or 12-bit if possible)
- 2+ D/A (10 or 12 bit)
- Ethernet w/ PHY  or CAN
- 2+ USART
- 2+ I2C
- can be powered over USB
- 64+K of SRAM
- 512+ K of Flash
- optionally powered and programmed over a USB link

I'd be happy with more, but I think this should work for a wide range  
of applications.  My first inclination if any one particular thing  
could be added would be: as much RAM as possible.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just one processing node ends up nearly as expensive as a central

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It continues to baffle me that the industry does not get the market  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for high-functionality, highly integrated, low pin-count devices &#8211;  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this seems so obvious for intelligent sensors and actuators. Even  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in the 8-bit field, Microchip makes lovely 6- and 8- pin chips  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ideal for embedding in, for example, a single limit switch, but  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they have no serial comms capability! You are up to 16 pin devices

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> memory seems to go hand in hand with high pin-count and therefore  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> complex and expensive packages and PCBs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the embedded space, parts get built to support specific  
</I>&gt;<i> (hopefully volume) applications.  This is why you might not see  
</I>&gt;<i> parts with a large number of on-chip peripherals, or lots of memory,  
</I>&gt;<i> etc.  In a previous professional gig, we built VoIP devices that  
</I>&gt;<i> shipped in moderate volume (1M-2M units/year).  This is a nice  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;sweet spot&quot; for a part manufacturer who would build a device  
</I>&gt;<i> targeted to that application which also happens to be price  
</I>&gt;<i> sensitive.  You don't want to ship parts out with unused peripherals  
</I>&gt;<i> or lots of extra memory because an extra $2 of cost per unit turns  
</I>&gt;<i> into a pretty noticeable numbers at 1,000,000 units shipped.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you're only talking about building a few hundred units, then the  
</I>&gt;<i> extra cost isn't really as much of a consideration, especially when  
</I>&gt;<i> you might be able to reduce the one-time engineering expense by  
</I>&gt;<i> optimizing time spent vs. &quot;extra&quot; hardware.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think that Marvell is building some interesting  higher-end parts,  
</I>&gt;<i> with perhaps a lack of GPIO I/O, A/D, etc. capability but with  
</I>&gt;<i> networking, etc.  Otherwise, you're looking to repurpose devices  
</I>&gt;<i> built for some targeted applications.
