What about in stamp form factor?

It would seem to me that this does a lot of what you're asking for  
(aside from ethernet):

It does, however, have built-in CAN.

I still have that board, and still need to finish the port for it :-)

It's an interesting board, and provide some nice interfaces for  
working with the various onboard peripherals:
<A HREF="http://mbed.co.uk/beta">http://mbed.co.uk/beta</A>

They provide on-line access to a RealView ARM compiler, which I don't  
think has any code size limits on it.  It also has some rather nice  
usability features like behaving like mass storage on a computer (just  
drop the bin files onto the drive and hit the reset button to upload  
firmware) and it presents a USB CDC for serial interaction over USB.
