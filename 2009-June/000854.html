Right, I've been taking a look at that to try and figure out how to  
integrate this into the RPC code.

I was thinking of having the clients exchange information about  
endianness and sizes when the connection is initiated.  I think I  
could just mimic the set of bytes used in the headers for a binary  
dump in order to get the right info exchanged.

Network order sounds like a good idea for parameters that are being  
exchanged.  I suppose whatever is done there should be consistent with  
how bytecode is handled as well.  My initial thought was to use header  
information exchanged when the connection is started to see who has  
what configuration (endianness, lua_Number type, etc..) and  only do  
translations if necessary, and have whoever supports more formats be  
responsible for putting things into alternate formats for less capable  
nodes (i.e.: a float machine can handle both float and int, an integer  
only one however would be the only one who can deal with float).  I  
may not get all of these cases covered for the initial version, but I  
would like it to at least work between an Intel 32 or 64 bit machine  
and a Cortex-M3 for starters.  I suppose one of the merits of just  
going with network ordering or standardized output is that if one  
were, say, broadcasting code over some network link to multiple  
machines at once, this would prevent having to do some sort of  
negotiation process.

Hmm... more experimentation and coding needed...
