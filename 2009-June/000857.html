<PRE>When I subscribed to this list half a year ago I confidently expected to be
able to use a single chip Lua device in my projects by now. I wanted to use
many such chips in a seriously distributed architecture with the processing
kept near to the IO to simplify wiring. To avoid buying an endless
succession of development boards I set a simple threshold specification of
512K on-chip flash, 64K on-chip RAM, Ethernet capability (I was prepared to
compromise with a second chip for this). With this type of distributed
architecture, I need lots of IO versatility (analog, PWM, UART, I2C, SPI,
counters etc.) but multiplexed on relatively few pins since if you run out
of IO you just add another chip. It should therefore be possible to have a
simple 20-40 pin package which could be available in hand-solderable form.

 

It is very disappointing that after many months still the only chip that
comes near is the LPC2888 which seems to be buggy and expensive (the very
minimalist LPC-H2888 prototype board is over $150). Looking at the
schematics for this board really reinforced my intuition about the
importance of on-chip memory - a ridiculous number of pins (and therefore
PCB traces) is wasted on the external memory interface. And the economics
are terrible - for just $20 more, you can get the new Acer Aspire Revo R3600
nettop (in Linux rather than Vista trim). The latter has both wired and
wireless networking, 1GB RAM and an 8GB SSD!

 

IO is the problem of course with an X86 platform. However in my research I
found this incredibly poorly marketed chip:

A versatile USB to IO pins chip for only $8! This looks like great universal
IO problem solver. Unlike most other DIY USB solutions I've seen which
require a driver and/or serial port emulator, this is HID based and
therefore driverless on all major OS's. I have ordered some of these chips
and will report back how it goes.

 

I am beginning to think it might just be better to cooperate with market
forces here since I suspect that X86 computing is going to keep widening the
functionality gap and reducing the price gap. Rather than trying to squeeze
Lua onto a cramped chip with no operating system, would it maybe be better
to produce a custom cut-down Linux distro with Lua built in (and perhaps
acting as the shell)?

 

What do others think? Will there be cheap, single chip ARM devices meeting
my spec available in the next few months?
