<PRE>If you're looking for a PC-level ARM development board, there are at least
four interesting choices:
1. BeagleBoard: $150 600MHz OMAP3530 Cortex A8, VLIW DSP, graphics, 256M
flash, 128M DRAM, HS USB 2.0, no Ethernet.
2. Gumstick Overo (OMAP35xx board) and Verdex (PXA270), starts at $129
3. Leopard board: $99, 210MHz 320DM355, camera, Ethernet, USB, 256M flash,
128M DRAM
4. Marvell Sheeva Plug, 1.2GHz Marvel Sheeva, 512M flash, 512M DRAM, Gigabit
Ethernet, USB

All of these are smaller than a nettop, and don't require any cooling fans.
With the x86 PC, you still have to add any interesting peripherals (ADC,
DAC, PWM, encoder, etc) via USB or similar.  BTW, USB interfaces using HID
will be very limited in speed.  And I think the simplicity of the eLua
approach is a major attraction; Linux is still Linux, even on a reduced-fat
system.

There have been plenty of exciting ARM announcements recently, ranging from
low end (Cortex-M3 such as the TI/Luminary 9B and STM32 Connectivity) up to
Gigahertz Cortex-A8 systems (TI, Freescale, etc).

It costs a significant amount of money to put a new MCU into production,
including design, verification, mask costs, and verification.  If you look
at all the functions the high-end MCUs support (e.g. Stellaris 9Bx), you'll
see that even 100 pins isn't very many.  Also, with the new chip-scale
packages (such as QFN and BGA), larger packages are smaller than lower pin
count old packages such as DIP and SOIC.  IIRC, Microchip and ST have some
models with very flexible I/O assignments, but there may be reasons why this
isn't widespread.  AFAIK, only Microchip is actively making new products in
hobbyist-friendly DIP packages; e.g. one of the smallest ARM MCUs, a 36-pin
STM32, is only available in QFN.  But Microchip doesn't have large memory
MCUs.  And, in summary, I doubt the demand is there for large memory, low
pin count MCUs.

Besides, I think it's better to use a Stamp format anyway (like the ET-STM32
Stamp) -- then you put all the required voltage regulators and clock stuff
up on the Stamp, and just have a reduced pin count, DIP-style interface to
your prototype board.

BTW, the AT32UC3A3256 has a couple other nice features Asko didn't mention:
high speed USB 2.0 (still not common in QFP), external SDRAM, and external
NAND support.  But there's no Ethernet.  Mouser pricing is $12.86 (1), $8.56
(100).

If you are looking for &gt;=64K SRAM, &gt;=256K flash, there are many choices.
Even at &gt;=96K SRAM, &gt;=512K flash, there are quite a few choices.  I'd say
the most interesting candidates for an eLua stamp right now are the UC3
(since it has 128K SRAM, external memory interfaces,  and HS USB) or the
Stellaris 9B (if it's available soon -- the $99 dev kits are in stock --
since it has 96K SRAM, Ethernet, USB, external memory interfaces, and cool
peripherals like PWM and quadrature encoders).
