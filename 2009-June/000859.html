<PRE>Hello,
   The boundaries between a gronwup embedded environment and a linux box are
indeed pretty vague these days. This is one of the reasons we don't have a
clear choice for our first eLua Stamp yet. I am personally confused with the
linux box solutions trend and feel bad for not having too much time to keep
an eye on this.
   But I don't think a X86 platform, enhanced with some more I/O capability
and running Lua with peripheral handling extensions will be the best answer
for the typical dedicated hardware platforms we all dream of, although it
can certainly have it's place too.
   Development boards/platforms are indeed expensive, because they sell in
relative low quantities. But it is not too hard to build a nice board for
eLua in for under US$ 50, in 10~50 quantities. We are actually buiding an
eLua board for some specific projects downhere, arround an LPC, with 8Mb
external RAM, 512Kb flash and it would come out about this prices, if we
have not to build it in a country like Brazil, where import taxes are a joke
and PCB building costs are abusive. I am pretty sure that later this year,
with the help of you guys, we will be able to come up with a nice and cheap
eLua Stamp that fits well in our pockets :)0
   Our motivations for eLua maybe somewhat different from the view of &quot;let's
embedd Lua on the best cost x benefit platform on the market&quot;. What we see
in the field instrumentation area (downhere) is that the hardware is
becoming more &quot;inteligent&quot;, moving from 8 bit platforms (that still dominate
82% of the market, according to Jack Ganssle) straight to 32 bits or to
hibrid architectures, where the 8 bit devices become &quot;satelites&quot; of a
central and more powerfull (32 bit) controller.
   This scenario clearly asks for better software tools and specially for
better development environments, where the final user, application/process
engineers and sensor technitians can program more functionality in their
products without the need of years of experience in Desktop-based
development, C/Asm languages etc....  To offer something powerfull and
simple as Lua, with peripheral handling libs/extensions/modules not only for
the peripheral world devices (ie: spi, uart, ad/da, ...) but for final
project &quot;parts&quot; (ie: gps, displays, kbds, ...), with no need for a PC-based
development for the upper &quot;layers&quot; of the aplications seems to be a nice
goal too.
    I think the X86 architecture will always be a strong &quot;market force&quot;,
although many low end netbooks (and that's what netbooks are, low end
laptops :) are also tasting ARM, for still lower prices and sizes. Linux
fits well on them all and may very acomodate Lua with embedded extensions to
offer what eLua wants to offer otherwise. But imho, the dedicated
sensor/instrumentation/appliance dedicated controllers will not be replaced
by these generic and customized linux-box based solutions, even considering
their price drop.
   Also, both solutions can coexist very well, leaving the pc-based and
software-expert development with the linux boxes and final-user and
process/product professionals with eLua.

Best
Dado

&gt;<i>  When I subscribed to this list half a year ago I confidently expected to

</I>&gt;<i> run out of IO you just add another chip. It should therefore be possible to

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is very disappointing that after many months still the only chip that

</I>&gt;<i> minimalist LPC-H2888 prototype board is over $150). Looking at the
</I>&gt;<i> schematics for this board really reinforced my intuition about the
</I>&gt;<i> importance of on-chip memory &#8211; a ridiculous number of pins (and therefore
</I>&gt;<i> PCB traces) is wasted on the external memory interface. And the economics
</I>&gt;<i> are terrible - for just $20 more, you can get the new Acer Aspire Revo R3600
</I>&gt;<i> nettop (in Linux rather than Vista trim). The latter has both wired and
</I>&gt;<i> wireless networking, 1GB RAM and an 8GB SSD!

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A versatile USB to IO pins chip for only $8! This looks like great
</I>&gt;<i> universal IO problem solver. Unlike most other DIY USB solutions I&#8217;ve seen
</I>&gt;<i> which require a driver and/or serial port emulator, this is HID based and
</I>&gt;<i> therefore driverless on all major OS&#8217;s. I have ordered some of these chips
</I>&gt;<i> and will report back how it goes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am beginning to think it might just be better to cooperate with market

</I>&gt;<i> Lua onto a cramped chip with no operating system, would it maybe be better
</I>&gt;<i> to produce a custom cut-down Linux distro with Lua built in (and perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> acting as the shell)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What do others think? Will there be cheap, single chip ARM devices meeting
</I>&gt;<i> my spec available in the next few months?
