They've got it at DigiKey in the US at least: 
<A HREF="http://search.digikey.com/scripts/DkSearch/dksus.dll?lang=en&amp;site=US&amp;WT.mc_id=hp_go_button&amp;KeyWords=AT91SAM7X512&amp;x=0&amp;y=0">http://search.digikey.com/scripts/DkSearch/dksus.dll?lang=en&amp;site=US&amp;WT.mc_id=hp_go_button&amp;KeyWords=AT91SAM7X512&amp;x=0&amp;y=0</A> 

&gt;<i> 
</I>They don't have a huge number in stock though... I guess there's not yet that much demand for parts with this much flash and RAM? 

&gt;<i> 
</I>How would any of you typically prototype with a device like this? Do you use a schmartboard or something similar? 

&gt;<i> You could use a Schmart board - and if you only want to do one board, that might be the best way. However, I would do a custom PCB - 2 layer should be fine. Getting a single PCB done is still expensive; if the board is small and you only want one, Batch PCB seems like the best option; if the board is larger or you want multiple boards, there are better options. For 4 layer boards, I'd highly recommend Sierra Proto Express, but for a design without external memory, 2 layers should be enough. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To give you an idea of pricing, Batch PCB is a straight $2.50 USD per square inch; at Proto Express, pricing in small quantities doesn't vary much with size (for &lt; 30 square inches), and is about $85 for one 2-layer PCB, and $110 total for 3 PCBs -- so it doesn't make sense to buy less than 3 PCBs from them. Pricing at most other fab houses is similar -- multiple boards are a much better value than one. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Thanks for the tips, I'll check out those services. Advanced Circuits also has a deal for 2-layer boards at $33 each (min qty 4, plus a free board) for a max size of 60 square inches:

The were friendly and helpful for my first board design (for a sensor) that I did recently. 

&gt;<i> BTW, at least in the US, low volume (&lt;25) assembly is quite pricey; it'll cost more than the components. That's why there are laser-cut stencils and toaster ovens (Sparkfun has some great resources on designing and assembling PCBs). 
</I>
I've not used stencils before, but perhaps I should look into it. After actually doing some boards for a project at work, I've realized it isn't actually all that bad. So, between getting small numbers of boards for $30-40 each and maybe doing my own assembly I don't have as many excuses (except for having too many main and side projects open at the moment) not to experiment with at least some simple prototypes :-)
