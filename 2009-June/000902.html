<PRE>Having just looked at the comSTICK yesterday, I have to agree that it  
covers quite a few bases in terms of peripherals and whatnot.  What I  
would love the most would be to combine the best of that STR9  
(ethernet, SRAM) chip with the best of their STM32 offerings (16 12- 
bit ADC, etc..).  They have STM32 chips that add ethernet in the  
pipeline, but the flash and SRAM are not really ideal (STM32F107 peaks  
out at 64k SRAM and 256k flash).

I think we keep coming back to the issue that most of these chips are  
about 80-90% of what you would want, but they fall short in some  
specific area that some other chip has built-in :-)

That could be interesting.  I'm not sure what the delta is there,  
though, between those hand soldered boards + components vs  
manufacturing a similar number of pre-assembled ones.  Also, I'm not  
sure what the difference in number of purchasers might be between the  
two styles, although one could always offer pre-assembled kits at a  
premium paid to whoever does the toasting &amp; testing.
