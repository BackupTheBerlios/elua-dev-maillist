<PRE>Thanks James, that is indeed quite close and it does all seem to be on chip
- I think the second chip is just an RS232 level shifter (RS232 - how last
century!). The LPC2368 is better though - Ethernet and 58kB RAM. The mbed
also looks kinda promising (except the 32k RAM) if they ever get it out of
beta, though I cannot see where they've hidden the Ethernet!

Commenting on the other points, I think the key is building market by
addressing a lot of relatively low volume applications through making really
flexible chips which means putting as much functionality in as possible. It
is also possible to vary the packaging to address different markets with the
same silicon - just put the same chip in a lower pin-count package and only
bring out a fraction of the IO. This would only really work with a full
crossbar switch between the peripherals and the IO though.
