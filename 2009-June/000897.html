<PRE> Hi
 I think that the concept of Lua Stamp, a single chip with Lua
embedded  could be great.
 My interest when find eLua was this: a single chip with peripherical
that could be used with other glue logic to build a system. 
 I see possibilities in industrial and home automation. consumer
devices and others.
 A simiIar initiative  is  .net micro framework  (
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/netmf/about/default.mspx">http://www.microsoft.com/netmf/about/default.mspx</A> [1]  )but is a
proprietary (ms) and a black box.
 Thanks
 Mars

 &gt;  &gt;  Thanks for the tips, I'll check out those services. Advanced
Circuits also has a deal for 2-layer boards at $33 each (min qty 4,
plus a free board) for a max size of 60 square inches:

 &gt; 
 &gt; The were friendly and helpful for my first board design (for a
sensor) that I did recently. &gt;  
 &gt; If you're happy with them, I'd say stick with them as your default
PCB fab house.
 &gt; 
 &gt; BTW, I'm curious what software others are using for PCB design. 
Are you using Advanced Circuits' PCB Artist?  I'm using Eagle PCB
(free at home, full at work).
 I'm using Eagle as well (free at home).  The recent design I did at
work I actually used an older version of TraxMaker because I was
working with someone who was familiar with it.
 I wouldn't mind using one of the open source tools out there,
however Eagle works quite well and has a nice built-in library of
components, and I don't see myself going beyond the constraints of
the freeware version for hobby projects soon.  If we do an open
design for a Lua Stamp, I'm not sure what would be the best choice
for the schematic and board layout.  I don't see that Eagle supports
any sort of open export format (I guess the gerber files are, but
that's not really ideal for something people can pick up and modify),
and a lot of other &quot;open hardware&quot; projects do just use Eagle (Arduino
for example).
 I _really_ wish that the schematic, board layout and part
description files were were done in some sort of open format, and
also that there were some sort of repository for part libraries that
one could just pull descriptions from automatically.  There is
something like this for gEDA here: <A HREF="http://www.gedasymbols.org/">http://www.gedasymbols.org/</A>
although it doesn't have as much breadth as would be nice.
 I know that some people do use gEDA for laying out and sending PCBs
to production, but I think the numbers are on the small side.
