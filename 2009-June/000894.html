</I>Thanks for the tips, I'll check out those services. Advanced Circuits also has a deal for 2-layer boards at $33 each (min qty 4, plus a free board) for a max size of 60 square inches:

</I>&gt;<i> BTW, I'm curious what software others are using for PCB design. Are you using Advanced Circuits' PCB Artist? I'm using Eagle PCB (free at home, full at work). 
</I>
I'm using Eagle as well (free at home). The recent design I did at work I actually used an older version of TraxMaker because I was working with someone who was familiar with it. 

I wouldn't mind using one of the open source tools out there, however Eagle works quite well and has a nice built-in library of components, and I don't see myself going beyond the constraints of the freeware version for hobby projects soon. If we do an open design for a Lua Stamp, I'm not sure what would be the best choice for the schematic and board layout. I don't see that Eagle supports any sort of open export format (I guess the gerber files are, but that's not really ideal for something people can pick up and modify), and a lot of other &quot;open hardware&quot; projects do just use Eagle (Arduino for example). 

I _really_ wish that the schematic, board layout and part description files were were done in some sort of open format, and also that there were some sort of repository for part libraries that one could just pull descriptions from automatically. There is something like this for gEDA here: <A HREF="http://www.gedasymbols.org/">http://www.gedasymbols.org/</A> although it doesn't have as much breadth as would be nice. 

I know that some people do use gEDA for laying out and sending PCBs to production, but I think the numbers are on the small side.
