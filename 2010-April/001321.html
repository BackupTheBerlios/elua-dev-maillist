<PRE>&gt;<i> Hi all
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am new to eLua, but have quite some, possibly somewhat rusty, Lua
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge. I intend to dive into eLua with a LM3S6965 Kit, which I didn't
</I>&gt;<i> order as of now, so I cannot test things. However, I am doing some upfront
</I>&gt;<i> thinking :-), and have the following question, which I hope is not too
</I>&gt;<i> obvious.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think I understand how to flash eLua to the board using Windows, and that
</I>&gt;<i> I'll then have a serial line emulated via the USB connection to the host
</I>&gt;<i> computer, both to download the eLua programs to the board and to control the
</I>&gt;<i> latter via a terminal. As host computer I'd like to use a Mac OS X box in
</I>&gt;<i> order to program the Lua application on the target board, once I have
</I>&gt;<i> flashed over eLua.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You're doing great so far :)


&gt;<i> If I understand the on-line docs, I can use the UART eLua generic module to
</I>&gt;<i> read and write to that serial-over-USB connection from Lua. I hope that's
</I>&gt;<i> correct.
</I>

It is. With one addition: you can use the UART module to communicate with
any serial port. One port might not be enough, but you can add another RS232
interface to your LM3S6965 board with a bit of soldering :), plug another
USB to serial adapter in your Mac, and use this as a separate line,
completely independent of the console UART. We also have a software UART
multiplexer in the works, but it's not checked in yet, and I'm not sure how
well it works on OS X (it should work just fine though).


&gt;<i> What I don't see yet is how to talk to that connection from Lua on my Mac
</I>&gt;<i> OS X system in order to implement a system with the remote part running on
</I>&gt;<i> the target board and the host part on my Mac, to realize some simple
</I>&gt;<i> communication between these parts. Think of something like a remote
</I>&gt;<i> debugger, with a remote probe and a console on the host. Is there some Lua
</I>&gt;<i> module for the host side of the serial? Or should I use the network
</I>&gt;<i> connection and use the Lua socket module?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It pretty much depends on what you're trying to do. There are more options
here:

- if you want to have Lua running on OS X and &quot;talk&quot; directly to the Lua
instance on the eLua board, the way to go is RPC :
<A HREF="http://www.eluaproject.net/en_using.html#rpc">http://www.eluaproject.net/en_using.html#rpc</A>
- if you just want to use the serial connection of your OS X directly from
the Lua interpreter running on OS X, I'm afraid I can't be of much help
here. From what I could gather (mostly from some discussions on the Lua
list), there isn't any official serial module for desktop Lua, although some
implementations exist. We might write a serial module at some point if
enough people show interest in this.
- you can of course use sockets to exchange data with the eLua board, but
I'd recommend you stick with serial, at least at the beginning. The
networking core still needs some work in eLua.

Best,
Bogdan
