<PRE>Hi all

I am new to eLua, but have quite some, possibly somewhat rusty, Lua knowledge. I intend to dive into eLua with a LM3S6965 Kit, which I didn't order as of now, so I cannot test things. However, I am doing some upfront thinking :-), and have the following question, which I hope is not too obvious.

I think I understand how to flash eLua to the board using Windows, and that I'll then have a serial line emulated via the USB connection to the host computer, both to download the eLua programs to the board and to control the latter via a terminal. As host computer I'd like to use a Mac OS X box in order to program the Lua application on the target board, once I have flashed over eLua.

If I understand the on-line docs, I can use the UART eLua generic module to read and write to that serial-over-USB connection from Lua. I hope that's correct. What I don't see yet is how to talk to that connection from Lua on my Mac OS X system in order to implement a system with the remote part running on the target board and the host part on my Mac, to realize some simple communication between these parts. Think of something like a remote debugger, with a remote probe and a console on the host. Is there some Lua module for the host side of the serial? Or should I use the network connection and use the Lua socket module?

Thanks for any help and hint!

Cheers
-- Stefan
