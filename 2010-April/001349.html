<PRE>I'm sorry my message could be interpreted as a complaint.  My intent was to ask the general question about pictures especially large ones.  I'm willing to invest some time in finding out how to use thumbnails once I know the community thinks it's a good idea.

In the future, would it be best to make changes to the wiki without requesting feedback/permission?  My nature feeling towards changing someone else's work is to first to ask permission.

Sorry Mike,
   It was my fault, that wanted to use my very few available minutes/day on these days to announce something nice, hoping that somebody else could help adjusting it to decent sizes. I thought that the table width/height parameters would do the trick and I left the picture resizing for sometime later, afterall this is why we have a Wiki, to refine it continuously in a true collaborative way.
   But it was my bad to have published the way it was and I'll be more careful from now on.

Thanks for the note!
Best
Dado

The large pictures on the user wiki can mess with the page layout on small screens.  Does the wiki have the option to show thumbnail images with the option to show the original?
