<PRE>Hello,

Thanks and welcome to the list.


&gt;<i> Why

Lwazi, this is one of the questions I hear more often and with more and more
(and cheaper) Linux embedded platforms around, we'll hear it much more in
the future.
It may deserve a long entry on our FAQ one of these days (any English
natively speaker to help ? :).
Differences go from a (muuuuuuuuuuuch) smaller footprint to full control of
your hardware by your programs, with nothing else &quot;in the middle&quot;.

-There is also not enough kernel-mode drivers for every peripheral of every
platform yet. It is much simpler to add them (MCU manufacturers usually make
available royalty-free libs if they are used only for their platforms) them
to eLua than to do the equivalent in Linux.
-You would also need to extend Lua with binds to these &quot;drivers&quot;, as Lua
itself does not have any module/lib to support mcu peripherals and the extra
auxiliary modules embedded programming requires. We've added a bunch of them
in eLua already.
-eLua has been running on 32bits MCUs for several years and only now, the
faster and external-memory-capable MCUs are getting cheaper enough for Linux
to be a nice option.
-We want to offer a simple embedded development framework for users not
necessarily deeply involved with software development, pretty much like what
the Arduino did for their typical users. In eLua, we would add to that
field-engineers that benefit from easy scripting and configuring their
process-oriented devices. Lua is simple to learn and to teach, which is not
always the case for Linux.

Does/Will eLua have threads that run directly on cpu cores?


Another long and interesting subject.
Preemtive multitasking is a great thing. On the embedded world, it can also
be one of the greatest nighmares one can have for modeling and debugging, if
you're not a computer science expert.
I'm not saying we don't want it but so far we've been following the greatest
Lua mottos: simplicity, minimamalism, elegance (in the sense of using other
approaches to the same goals), ......
Coroutine (non-preemptive multitasking) is a great and simple approach that
hasn't been explored or well supported by most high-level languages in the
past. Lua implements it very nicely and eLua benefits from it without a
single extra byte of code.
It is sufficient for most embedded applications and it is a blessing for the
newcomers and a large part of the eLua audience too.
I would be very glad to have true/preemptive multitasking in eLua in the
future, if we have some more help for the dev and we come to an elegant and
light implementation.
You can have it today, if you strugle a bit with an RTOS and run multiple
copies of eLua but keep in mind that we haven't architectured eLua for it.
With the modern MCUs going multicore too, we might have more code support
and expertise in the future to try a decent model too.


I have a thousand other questions and thoughts but I will leave that for
&gt;<i> another thread maybe.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Nice, we'll be glad to hear them all.
Thanks for sharing this !


&gt;<i> Thanks,
