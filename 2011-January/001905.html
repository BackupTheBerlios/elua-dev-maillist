Don't let anybody (me included) discourage you. Just because me or
others don't find this a good idea it doesn't mean it actually isn't a
good idea :) If you'd like to work on something like this do it
anyway. After all results are all that matters, so if you get good
results you'll be able to prove your detractors wrong :) Just for the
record I don't think the idea is bad, just strange in an interesting
(but not very useful) way.

&gt;<i> I know these benchmarks are not always accurate but according to this:

Welcome to the wonderful world of
benchmarks-which-many-times-aren't-relevant-in-the-real-world :)

&gt;<i> Having said all this I would have expected that removing Lua from a

</I>
That actually makes sense. Eliminating the interpreter inner loop
might have an actual (and observable) performance impact.

&gt;<i> I have not done much with serialization but I was thinking about serializing
</I>&gt;<i> the L state struct and trying to reload it back without including the lua

I can't say that I understood this part very well, but why don't you
start with something like lua2c (mentioned on my previous e-mail) and
build from there? It does exactly what you want: it turns Lua code
into C code. And it doesn't require any modifications to Lua itself.
If you're satisfied with the results you can work from there, removing
the parser (the Lua distribution already has an example on how to do
this) and maybe the bytecode interpreter and so on (note though that
you'll have some issues if you do this, for example 'loadstring' won't
work anymore). You don't have to start with modifying Lua itself. I
can tell you this can become quite a bit challenging (especially
something like modifying the Lua state structure which touches almost
every part of the code).

&gt;<i>I am not even sure if this would work at all but if it did it might
</I>&gt;<i> give me some idea of the savings of just having what is contained in L which

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If this is all false could you rescue me from myself?
</I>
I don't know if modifying L is the first thing to think about.
Depending on what you'll end up removing from standard Lua you might
be able to come down with a stripped down version of L, although I
doubt that this will have a significant impact. Understanding what
parts of code you can remove/make smaller, on the other hand, might
make a big difference and it might also be easier to implement.

Best,
Bogdan
