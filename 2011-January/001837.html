</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I took a look at the chapter list and I'd like to understand the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> purpose of this project better. Your initial message said &quot;We're
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> writing a book for a tiny computer that runs eLua natively&quot; (which is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> great BTW :) ). My problem is that I don't really understand what the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> idea of an &quot;eLua computer&quot; is to you. I can see chapters like this in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> your book:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - list of pin assignments on connectors, *memory map* and other stuff
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from the mizar32 wiki
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - invitation to produce your own boards and derivatives
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Compiling the eLua interpreter from source using Ubuntu, as flash
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> image or for SD card with eLuaBLOD
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Flashing firmware using DFU bootloader
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Mention mizar32 Google code project for precompiled firmware and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> latest patches
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This hints to the fact that your eLua computer is targeted towards
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> experienced developers. Nothing wrong with this, I just want to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> understand where you're trying to go, as my own ideas about an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> eLua-based computer are a bit diferent and I need to understand yours.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Una cosa importante, e' che il libro sia veramente popolare,

</I>&gt;<i> or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Something important is that the book be truly (er, literally, &quot;aimed at the general populace&quot;; it's not non &quot;popular&quot; as in &quot;with lots of people who like it&quot;),
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so not aimed at university types but at everyone.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks. I just put down what would seem absolutely necessary to me as
</I>&gt;<i> a developer or to someone like me at mid-late school age. I'm used to
</I>&gt;<i> teaching 18-21s, but that is just be a professional deformity of mine.
</I>&gt;<i> :)
</I>&gt;<i> But absolutely i agree, defining the target audience is critical.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the 80s Acorn (as it was then) produced &quot;Atomic Theory and
</I>&gt;<i> Practice&quot; teaching programming in BASIC and even a full course in 6502
</I>&gt;<i> assembler(*). It was a huge step in my programming education and I
</I>&gt;<i> devoured every page. But something like that takes a year to write.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My first hack at a contents list is just a collection of the essential
</I>&gt;<i> info for a geek, plus a scraping of the wikis and mailing list posts.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm also anxious to lift as much of it as possible from existing
</I>&gt;<i> sources, of course.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Should we (can we?) include the Atmel datasheet which describes the
</I>&gt;<i> operation and register layout of the devices? &#160;Does book size
</I>&gt;<i> significantly increase the printing costs or not? Shipping for sure,
</I>&gt;<i> as extra weight.
</I>
A few thoughts on this front:
I wouldn't include a full datasheet up front (and certainly not the
whole manual, since I'm sure that's over 100 pages :-)), but I
definitely would include quick-reference material that will be
essential for operation of the peripherals (like which output pins
correspond to what functions, and maybe tables of configuration
parameters if they're configurable on different pins).  I'd try to
keep what's in the document down to the essentials and leave the nitty
gritty details to the datasheet or some other online resource.  Here's
an example of such a quick-reference page from mbed:
<A HREF="http://mbed.org/handbook/mbed-NXP-LPC1768">http://mbed.org/handbook/mbed-NXP-LPC1768</A> (they also ship a
credit-card sized plastic card in the box that has that image on the
top printed on it)

As far as how one would present other content in the book, I would
start with things that the user can immediately dive into and get
working, starting with simpler examples so that the user will feel
like they have a handle on what each line of code is doing and what
all the connections are for, and moving on to more advanced examples
(on a graduated basis, I wouldn't immediately jump to something like
&quot;writing your own C module!&quot;).  As above, I would be selective about
including highly detailed technical things, but quick references and
cheat sheets are fabulous to have in paper form for both novice and
advanced users when they have already gotten a handle on things but
can't remember what function does one thing or another.  For
peripheral modules, I might even include very short examples for the
patterns for configuring a module and sending/receiving information
using that peripheral.

I guess one other question to ask is whether this is to be reference
material or a quick start guide.  I don't think that included
documentation needs to be exhaustive as long as more detailed
information is available quickly and easily online.  I think there
should be some sort of happy medium where the printed document is
useful both when the user is just getting started (to keep them
interested and motivated) and to more advanced users (providing some
useful quick reference information) without having it take a year or
more to put together.  Of course, one can always make revisions as
time goes along and respond to feedback from users.  Updated versions
can go in the latest shipping text and be available online so that
users can read them on the computer, print them out or consume them in
some other medium.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Should we include stuff that's already on the web? I'd say yes, since
</I>&gt;<i> printed book format is much easier to learn from, read on the bus and
</I>&gt;<i> use as a reference while hacking. The pages should become stained with
</I>&gt;<i> food :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This points to a slim volume with reference data primarily, with
</I>&gt;<i> explanations around each item explaining its main components, how they
</I>&gt;<i> talk to each other and how to read the following diagrams/tables.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Like I said: my list is a collection of the material we already have,
</I>&gt;<i> largely. If someone has a different overall structure in mind, or if
</I>&gt;<i> someone can brainstorm an alternative content list, we could add them
</I>&gt;<i> as alternative chapter lists, then synthesize a single work later on.
</I>&gt;<i> Feel free to modify the existing one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; M
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *) with their amazing in-BASIC assembler, which would write machine
</I>&gt;<i> instructions sequentially in RAM at the address pointed to by P
</I>&gt;<i> autoincrementing P as a side effect, with some extra keywork to jump
</I>&gt;<i> to it as a subroutine. Example:
</I>&gt;<i> P=32768
</I>&gt;<i> FOR I = 1 TO 10 DO
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;[ NOP; ]
</I>&gt;<i> END
</I>&gt;<i> [ RTS; ]
</I>&gt;<i> CALL 32768
</I>&gt;<i> (or something like that. Sorry, I forget the BASIC syntax for FOR
</I>&gt;<i> loops. Thankfully.)
