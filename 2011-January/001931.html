Subject: Re: [eLua-dev] eLua vs Lua on RTOS

 

 Incidentally, I remember being very impressed that the BASIC-STAMP
microcontroller had preemptive multitasking integrated with the
(interpreted) Basic language, this on an 8-bit chip with only a few hundred
*bytes* of RAM. I was able to write a really good serial comms handler for
GPS using this, which would have been virtually impossible without. A good
RTOS can actually save RAM by avoiding the need for large RAM buffers for
incoming data.

 

This is true in general, but probably not so much when running a virtual
machine. A simple example for the GPS driver you mentioned ealier: take a
serial port configured at 115200 baud. You receive a number of bytes on this
serial port from a GPS. If you were to do this with eLua you'd have to call
your serial interrupt handler 11520 times per second. Might be just a bit
too much for eLua; it might or it might not be quick enough to get all the
bytes (this is of course largely dependent on the platform and I can't make
any estimation about the actual resources you'd need to acomplish this). Now
imagine that you have a serial driver written in C that will call your Lua
interrupt handler when an event happens: for example when a configurable
number of bytes were received (like a FIFO) or when a certain character was
received on the input stream. In our GPS case scenario we can use the second
option: the C driver will send an interrupt when a '\n' is received (which
ends the GPS sentence). In turn eLua will acknowledge this interrupt and
read all the sentence (which is already stored in the C driver's buffers),
then parse it and do whatever it needs with it. Of course the C driver is
free to read the following GPS sentence while eLua processes the current
sentence. Personally I find this model much more suitable for a system that
runs around a VM and needs to handle real time data communication.

 

[John Hind] Yes, a well designed com port driver can provide for the most
common and simple packet designs such as fixed length or variable length
with a terminating control code. But even with a GPS sentence, you need to
provide a RAM buffer for a complete sentence while a byte-by-byte approach
only requires buffering for the data you need in the application. In my
case, I simply slowed the baud rate down until I could handle it
byte-by-byte - no point in transferring one update per second in a
microsecond! Also it is hard to cope with more complex cases of the sort
than need a state-machine parser. If you have to write specialised device
drivers and compile an application specific image for most applications, it
severely reduces the appeal of the virtual machine approach.
