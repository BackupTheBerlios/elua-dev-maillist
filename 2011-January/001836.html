&gt;<i> I took a look at the chapter list and I'd like to understand the
</I>&gt;<i> purpose of this project better. Your initial message said &quot;We're
</I>&gt;<i> writing a book for a tiny computer that runs eLua natively&quot; (which is
</I>&gt;<i> great BTW :) ). My problem is that I don't really understand what the
</I>&gt;<i> idea of an &quot;eLua computer&quot; is to you. I can see chapters like this in
</I>&gt;<i> your book:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - list of pin assignments on connectors, *memory map* and other stuff
</I>&gt;<i> from the mizar32 wiki
</I>&gt;<i> - invitation to produce your own boards and derivatives
</I>&gt;<i> - Compiling the eLua interpreter from source using Ubuntu, as flash
</I>&gt;<i> image or for SD card with eLuaBLOD
</I>&gt;<i> - Flashing firmware using DFU bootloader
</I>&gt;<i> - Mention mizar32 Google code project for precompiled firmware and
</I>&gt;<i> latest patches
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This hints to the fact that your eLua computer is targeted towards
</I>&gt;<i> experienced developers. Nothing wrong with this, I just want to
</I>&gt;<i> understand where you're trying to go, as my own ideas about an
</I>&gt;<i> eLua-based computer are a bit diferent and I need to understand yours.

&gt;<i> Una cosa importante, e' che il libro sia veramente popolare,
</I>&gt;<i> quindi non mirato agli universitari ma a tutti.
</I>or
&gt;<i> Something important is that the book be truly (er, literally, &quot;aimed at the general populace&quot;; it's not non &quot;popular&quot; as in &quot;with lots of people who like it&quot;),
</I>&gt;<i> so not aimed at university types but at everyone.
</I>
Thanks. I just put down what would seem absolutely necessary to me as
a developer or to someone like me at mid-late school age. I'm used to
teaching 18-21s, but that is just be a professional deformity of mine.
:<i>)
</I>But absolutely i agree, defining the target audience is critical.

In the 80s Acorn (as it was then) produced &quot;Atomic Theory and
Practice&quot; teaching programming in BASIC and even a full course in 6502
assembler(*). It was a huge step in my programming education and I
devoured every page. But something like that takes a year to write.

My first hack at a contents list is just a collection of the essential
info for a geek, plus a scraping of the wikis and mailing list posts.
I'm also anxious to lift as much of it as possible from existing
sources, of course.

Should we (can we?) include the Atmel datasheet which describes the
operation and register layout of the devices?  Does book size
significantly increase the printing costs or not? Shipping for sure,
as extra weight.

Should we include stuff that's already on the web? I'd say yes, since
printed book format is much easier to learn from, read on the bus and
use as a reference while hacking. The pages should become stained with
food :)

This points to a slim volume with reference data primarily, with
explanations around each item explaining its main components, how they
talk to each other and how to read the following diagrams/tables.

Like I said: my list is a collection of the material we already have,
largely. If someone has a different overall structure in mind, or if
someone can brainstorm an alternative content list, we could add them
as alternative chapter lists, then synthesize a single work later on.
Feel free to modify the existing one.

   M

*) with their amazing in-BASIC assembler, which would write machine
instructions sequentially in RAM at the address pointed to by P
autoincrementing P as a side effect, with some extra keywork to jump
to it as a subroutine. Example:
P=32768
FOR I = 1 TO 10 DO
  [ NOP; ]
END
[ RTS; ]
CALL 32768
(or something like that. Sorry, I forget the BASIC syntax for FOR
loops. Thankfully.)
