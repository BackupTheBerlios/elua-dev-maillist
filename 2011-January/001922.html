Yes, otherwise those pins are unusable. At present they are only
accessible by trial and error using names like PD_01 for PX33 with no
correspondence between the PD/PE names and the PX pin names, nor with
the GPIO numbers.  You can only find out which is which by random
probing.

&gt;<i> if this will result in a major refactor or loss of performance, maybe we could let
</I>&gt;<i> it out.

It doesn't. If affects the inside of one function with an extra &quot;case&quot;
statement #if AVR32 only without changing anything else, and only
affects the input syntax for naming these pins when building for
AVR32.  I guess I should have inclouded some explanation at the top of
the patch file that I sent, to explain better the differences that it
makes (it practically nothing). It seems to be scaring several people,
probably because it is unclear what it does.
   I admit it was difficult to get my head round the four naming
systems then in use: PXnn pins, GPIOnn pin numbers, the old phantom PD
and PE ports (which exist even less than PX does; there are four
32-bit ports in reality) and the actual port C/D pins that each of the
&quot;PX&quot; pins is in reality.

PX00-PX10 = GPIO100-GPIO90 = Port 3 pins 04-00; port 2 pins 31-26
PX11-PX14 = GPIO109-GPIO106 = Port 3 pins 13-10
PX15-PX34 = GPIO89-GPIO70 = Port 2 pins 25-06
PX35-PX39 = GPIO105-GPIO101 = Port 3 pins 09-05

I only mapped a few of the old internal PD_ and PE_ eLua names of a
few pins, but they had nothing to do with any of the above 3 naming
schemes, but were yet another seemingly random mapping. I only
discovered some of them by running a program to read all pins of port
D (or E) and print a 32-bit mask, then take the few free GPIOs high
and low with a resistor to see which bit changed.
The old, random PD_ and PE_ names for the ones I mapped are still
noted in the section &quot;Elua view&quot; of
<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/mizar32/wiki/GPIO">http://code.google.com/p/mizar32/wiki/GPIO</A>

PX16 	GPIO88 	P7 pin 13 	pio.PD_18
PX19 	GPIO85 	P7 pin 12 	pio.PD_15
PX22 	GPIO82 	P7 pin 11 	pio.PD_12
PX33 	GPIO71 	P6 pin 10 	pio.PD_1

This patch removes the craziest of these naming schemes, which existed
only in eLua, and lets users use one of the already existing set of
names.

&gt;&gt;<i> If you can find somewhere in the eLua code where this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is done, it may be worth the trouble to re-map these pins back to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;PX&quot; names.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't remember seeing anywhere where this is done.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think this is done on the Lua bind maps but I couldn't find or remember it
</I>&gt;<i> quickly neither.
</I>
Well, if it starts printing PC_27 and PD_14 some time can we leave
someone to report that as a bug?
It should be harmless.
