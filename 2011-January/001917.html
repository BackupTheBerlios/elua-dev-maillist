Yes, this is new eLua feature and the initial doc will be release with v0.8

src/platform/lpc24xx

*

&gt;<i> What happens to the rest of

You mean, the aparent-latency wait until we actually handle the INT in Lua ?
The Lua VM is executing during this. I think the hook checks for any queued
INT to handle every 2 or 3 VM bytecodes.


&gt;<i> I presume the ISR and other interrupts

</I>&gt;<i>

   As a preview of the doc to come, I'll paste here some infos about the
Interrupt mechanism v0.8 will bring officially to eLua.
   Comments and reviews are welcomed.
   (and yes, the doc edition/refinement by the community will be easier in
the future :)

eLua interrupt handlers

Starting with version 0.8, *eLua* supports interrupt handlers written in
Lua. Once an interrupt handler is set in the Lua code, it will be called
each time a supported interrupt is generated. A *supported interrupt* is any
interrupt that is handled by the platform C code (see here for more
details).

*IMPORTANT*: before learning how to use interrupt handlers in Lua, please
keep in mind that Lua interrupt handlers don&#8217;t work the same way as regular
(C) interrupt handlers. As Lua doesn&#8217;t have direct suport for interrupts,
they have to be emulated. *eLua* emulates them using a queue that is
populated with interrupt data by the C support code. As long as the queue is
not empty, a Lua hook is set to run every 2 Lua bytecode instructions. This
hook function is the Lua interrupt handler. After all the interrupts are
handled and the queue is emptied, the hook is automatically disabled.
Consequently:

   -

   When the interrupt queue is full (a situation that might appear when
   interrupts are added to the queue faster than the Lua code can handle them)
   subsequent interrupts are ignored (not added to the queue) and an error
   message is printed on the *eLua* console device. The interrupt queue size
   can be configured at build time, as explained here. Even if the interrupt
   queue is large, one most remember that Lua code is significantly slower than
   C code, thus not all C interrupts make suitable candidates for Lua interrupt
   handlers. For example, a serial interrupt that is generated each time a char
   is received at 115200 baud might be too fast for Lua (this is largely
   dependent on the platform). On the other hand, a GPIO interrupt-on-change on
   a GPIO line connected with a matrix keyboard is a very good candidate for a
   Lua handler. Experimenting with different interrupt types is the best way to
   find the interrupts that work well with Lua.
   -

   A more subtle point is that the Lua virtual machine must *run* for the
   interrupt handlers to work. A simple analogy is that a CPU must have a
   running clock in order to function properly (and in order to take care of
   the hardware interrupts). If the clock is stopped, the CPU doesn&#8217;t run and
   the interrupt handlers aren&#8217;t called anymore, although the occurence of the
   interrupt might be recorded inside the CPU. This is the exact same situation
   with Lua: if the virtual machine doesn&#8217;t run, the interrupts are still
   recorded in the interrupt queue, but the Lua handler won&#8217;t be called until
   the virtual machine runs again. In this case though, the &quot;clock&quot; of the Lua
   VM is a C function that is executed for every VM instruction. If this
   function blocks for some reason, the VM instructions are not executed
   anymore. It&#8217;s not hard to make this function block; for example, it blocks
   everytime the Lua code waits for some user input at the console, or when a
   TODO tmr.delay is executed, or when TODO uart.read is called with an
   infinite or very large timeout; in general, any function from a Lua library
   that doesn&#8217;t return immediately (or after a short ammount of time) will
   block the VM. Care must be taken to avoid such operations as much as
   possible, otherwise the interrupt support code won&#8217;t run properly.
   -

   There is a single interrupt handler per interrupt type in Lua (the same
   holds true for C interrupt support), as opposed to the many hardware
   interrupts handlers usually found on the *eLua* targets. It is however
   easy to differentiate between different interrupt sources, as will be
   explained in the next paragraph.
   -

   Lua interrupt handlers are never reentrant.

While this might seem restrictive, Lua interrupt handlers work quite well in
practical situations. As an added bonus, since they are implemented by C
support code, there&#8217;s nothing preventing *eLua* from implementing &quot;custom
interrupts&quot; (software generated interrupts that don&#8217;t correspond to a
hardware interrupt on the CPU), such as serial interrupt on char match
(generate an interrupt when a certain char is received on the serial port,
for example a newline), timer interrupts for virtual timers, TCP/UDP data
packet received interrupt and many others.
 Using interrupt handlers in Lua

To enable Lua interrupt handler, define *BUILD_LUA_INT_HANDLERS* and *
PLTATFORM_INT_QUEUE_LOG_SIZE* in *platform_conf.h* (see here for details).
Setting up interrupt handlers is a straightforward process, most of the
required functionality is provided by the CPU module:

   -

   use *cpu.set_int_handler( int_id, handler )* to set the interrupt handler
   function for the specified interrupt (call with *nil* to disable the
   interrupt handler for that interrupt). *cpu.set_int_handler* returns the
   previous interrupt handler for *int_id* (or *nil* is an interrupt handler
   was not previously set for the interrupt). In most cases, your interrupt
   handler should call the previous handler to ensure proper interrupt
   management.
   -

   use *cpu.sei( int_id, resnum1, [resnum2], &#8230;, [resnumn])* and *cpu.cli(
   int_id, resnum1, [resnum2], &#8230;, [resnumn])* to enable/disable specific CPU
   interrupts that will trigger the interrupt handler. You can also use *
   cpu.sei()* and *cpu.cli* (without parameters) to enable/disable global
   interrupts on the CPU, although this is not recommended.

The interrupt handler receives the *resource ID* that specifies the resource
that fired the interrupt. It can be a timer ID for a timer overflow
interrupt, a GPIO port/pin combination for a GPIO interrupt on pin change, a
SPI interface ID for a SPI data available interrupt, and so on.

An example that uses the above concepts and knows how to handle two
different interrupt types is presented below:

local vtmrid = tmr.VIRT0
local to = 1500000

local prev_tmr, new_prev_tmr, prev_gpio

-- This is the timer interrupt handler
*local function tmr_handler( resnum )*

  print( string.format( &quot;Timer interrupt for id %d&quot;, resnum ) )
  if prev_tmr then prev_tmr( resnum ) end
end

-- This is the timer interrupt handler that gets set after tmr_handler
*local function new_tmr_handler( resnum )*

  print( string.format( &quot;NEW HANDLER: timer interrupt for id %d&quot;, resnum ) )
  -- This will chain to the previous interrupt handler (tmr_handler above)
  if new_prev_tmr then new_prev_tmr( resnum ) end

end

-- This is the GPIO interrupt on change (falling edge) interrupt
*local function gpio_negedge_handler( id, resnum )*
    local port, pin = pio.decode( resnum )

  print( string.format( &quot;GPIO NEGEDGE interrupt on port %d, pin %d&quot;,
port, pin ) )
  if prev_gpio then prev_gpio( resnum ) end
end

-- Set timer interrupt handler
*prev_tmr = cpu.set_int_handler( cpu.INT_TMR_MATCH, tmr_handler )*

-- Set GPIO interrupt on change (negative edge) interrupt handler
*prev_gpio = cpu.set_int_handler( cpu.INT_GPIO_NEGEDGE, gpio_negedge_handler )*
-- Setup periodic timer interrupt for virtual timer 0
*tmr.set_match_int( vtmrid, to, tmr.INT_CYCLIC )*
-- Enable GPIO interrupt on change (negative edge) for pin 0 of port 0
*cpu.sei( cpu.INT_GPIO_NEGEDGE, pio.P0_0 )*

-- Enable timer match interrupt on virtual timer 0
*cpu.sei( cpu.INT_TMR_MATCH, vtmrid )*

local tmrid, count = 0, 0
while true do
  print &quot;Outside interrupt&quot;

  for i = 1, 1000 do tmr.delay( tmrid, 1000 ) end
  if uart.getchar( uartid, 0 ) ~= &quot;&quot; then break end
  count = count + 1
  if count == 5 then
    print &quot;Changing timer interrupt handler&quot;

    *new_prev_tmr = cpu.set_int_handler( cpu.INT_TMR_MATCH, new_tmr_handler )*
  end
end

-- Cleanup
-- Stop the timer from generating periodic interrupts
*tmr.set_match_int( vtmrid, 0, tmr.INT_CYCLIC );*

-- Disable the GPIO interrupt on change (negative edge) interrupt
*cpu.cli( cpu.INT_GPIO_NEGEDGE, pio.P0_0 )*
-- Disable the timer interrupt on match interrupt
*cpu.cli( cpu.INT_TMR_MATCH, vtmrid )*

-- Clear the timer interrupt handler
*cpu.set_int_handler( cpu.INT_TMR_MATCH, nil );*
-- Clear the GPIO interrupt handler
*cpu.set_int_handler( cpu.INT_GPIO_NEGEDGE, nil );*

 This is the most common use case for Lua interrupts, but it&#8217;s not the only
one. Another way to use interrupts from *eLua* uses *polling* instead of
interrupt handlers: directly check the interrupt flags and execute a certain
action when one of them becomes set. For this, use the *cpu.get_int_flag(
id, resnum, [clear] )* function from the CPU module, which returns the
specified interrupt&#8217;s status for resource *resnum*. *clear* is an optional
boolean parameter, specifying if the interrupt flag should be cleared if it
is set. It defaults to *true*, and in most cases it shouldn&#8217;t be changed.
Using this feature, it becomes easy to wait for one or more interrupt
flag(s) to be set. To use interrupt polling:

   -

   Enable/disable interrupts to be polled with
*cpu.hw_sei*/*cpu.hw_cli*instead of
   *cpu.sei*/*cpu.cli*. These functions enable/disable interrupts only in
   hardware, as opposed to *cpu.sei*/*cpu.cli* that also set/clear an
   internal flag which makes the interrupt able to trigger a Lua handler.
   -

   Use *cpu.get_int_flag* to get the interrupt flag.

The *int_select* function below is a possible implementation of a function
that gets an array of interrupts and returns the first one that gets active:

function int_select( int_table )
  while true do
    for i = 1, #int_table do
      local t = int_table[ i ]
      if *cpu.get_int_flag[ t[ 1 ], t[ 2 ] )* then

        return t[ 1 ], t[ 2 ]
      end
    end
 end
end

*cpu.hw_sei( cpu.INT_GPIO_NEGEDGE, pio.P0_0 )*
*cpu.hw_sei( cpu.INT_TMR_MATCH, tmr.VIRT0 )*

local ints = { { cpu.INT_GPIO_NEGEDGE, pio.P0_0 }, {
cpu.INT_TMR_MATCH, tmr.VIRT0 } }
-- int_select will wait for either INT_GPIO_NEGEDGE or INT_TMR_MATCH
to become active
print( int_select( ints ) )

 Note that the two mechanisms (interrupt handlers and polling) can be used
in parallel as long as an interrupt is not set with both *cpu.hw_sei* and *
cpu.sei*, in which case the bevahiour is unpredictable. This is why it makes
sense to write the *int_select* function above in Lua instead of C: it keeps
the Lua VM running, so Lua interrupt handlers can be executed.
 Interrupt handlers in C

The interrupt subsystem has also a basic C API that can be used to implement
portable *eLua* components and modules. It is enabled by defining *
BUILD_C_INT_HANDLERS* in *platform_conf.h*. It is defined in *inc/elua_int.h
* and has 2 functions:
 elua_int_c_handler elua_int_set_c_handler( elua_int_id inttype,
elua_int_c_handler phandler )

Sets the interrupt handler for interrupt *inttype* to *phandler* and returns
the previous interrupt handler for interrupt *inttype*.
 elua_int_c_handler elua_int_get_c_handler( elua_int_id inttype )

Returns the interrupt handler for interrupt *inttype*

*elua_int_c_handler* is a function that doesn&#8217;t return anything and receives
a single parameter of type *elua_int_resnum* to differentiate between the
sources (GPIO pin, UART id, timer id and so on) that can trigger the
interrupt *inttype*. This is similar in functionality with the Lua handlers.

To work with interrupts from C code use these functions defined by the CPU
platform interface:
 int platform_cpu_set_interrupt( elua_int_id id, elua_int_resnum resnum, int
status )

Enable (*status* = *PLATFORM_CPU_ENABLE*) or disable (*status* = *
PLATFORM_CPU_DISABLE*) interrupt *id* for resource *resnum*.
 int platform_cpu_get_interrupt( elua_int_id id, elua_int_resnum resnum )

Returns 1 if interrupt *id* is enabled for resource *resnum*, 0 otherwise.
 int platform_cpu_get_interrupt_flag( elua_int_id id, elua_int_resnum
resnum, int clear )

Get interrupt flag for interrupt *id* and resource *resnum*, clear interrupt
flag if it is set and *clear* is 1, leave it untouched otherwise.

Since *elua_int_set_c_handler* returns the previous handler, it is easy to
chain the interrupt handlers from different system components. To ensure
correct operation, every C module that needs access to interrupt handlers
should use this sequence:

#include &quot;elua_int.h&quot;

static elua_int_c_handler prev_handler;
static void int_handler( elua_int_resnum resnum );

void module_init()
{
  int id = SOME_INT_ID;

  platform_cpu_set_interrupt( id, some_resnum, PLATFORM_CPU_ENABLE );

  prev_handler = elua_int_set_c_handler( id, int_handler );
}

static void int_handler( elua_int_resnum resnum )
{
  // Note: prev_handler can also be called at the end of int_handler
  if( prev_handler )

    prev_handler( resnum );

  // (Optional) Check resnum and return if the interrupt was fired by
a different resource
  if( resnum != some_resnum )
    return;

  // Actual interrupt handler code comes here

}

 int platform_cpu_get_interrupt( elua_int_id id, elua_int_resnum resnum )

Returns 1 if interrupt *id* is enabled for resource *resnum*, 0 otherwise.
 int platform_cpu_get_interrupt_flag( elua_int_id id, elua_int_resnum
resnum, int clear )

    prev_handler( resnum );

  // (Optional) Check resnum and return if the interrupt was fired by
a different resource
  if( resnum != some_resnum )
    return;

  // Actual interrupt handler code comes here

-------------------------------

eLua interrupt support implementation

To add interrupt support for an *eLua* platform follow the steps below:

   1.

   *Define your interrupts*

   Your interrupt sources should be defined in platform_conf.h with macros
   (don&#8217;t use C enumerations). The first one should have the value *
   ELUA_INT_FIRST_ID* (defined in *inc/elua_int.h*), the next one
*ELUA_INT_FIRST_ID
   + 1* and so on. Also, there should be a definition for a macro called *
   INT_ELUA_LAST* that must be equal to the largest interrupt source value.
   An example is given below:

   #define INT_GPIO_POSEDGE      ELUA_INT_FIRST_ID
   #define INT_GPIO_NEGEDGE      ( ELUA_INT_FIRST_ID + 1 )
   #define INT_TMR_MATCH         ( ELUA_INT_FIRST_ID + 2 )
   #define INT_ELUA_LAST         INT_TMR_MATCH

    Note that the interrupt names aren&#8217;t random, they should follow a well
   defined pattern. Check here for details.
   2.

   *Add them to the list of constants from the CPU module*

   Check the documentation of the CPU module for details.
   3.

   *Implement your support functions*

   The actual implementation of the interrupt handlers is of course platform
   specific, so it can stay in the *platform.c* file. However, since
   interrupt handlers might require quite a bit of code, it is recommended to
   implement them in a separate file. The *eLua* convention is to use the *
   platform_int.c* file for this purpose. For each interrupt defined in step
   1 above, 3 functions need to be implemented:
    -

      A function that enables or disables the interrupt and returns its
      previous state (enabled or disabled).
      -

      A function that checks if the interrupt is enabled or disabled.
      -

      A function that checks the interrupt pending flag and optionally
      clears it.

   These functions are defined in *inc/elua_int.h*, which also defines an
   &quot;int descriptor&quot; type:

   // Interrupt functions and descriptor
   typedef int ( *elua_int_p_set_status )( elua_int_resnum resnum, int state );
   typedef int ( *elua_int_p_get_status )( elua_int_resnum resnum );
   typedef int ( *elua_int_p_get_flag )( elua_int_resnum resnum, int clear );

   typedef struct
   {
     elua_int_p_set_status int_set_status;
     elua_int_p_get_status int_get_status;
     elua_int_p_get_flag int_get_flag;
   } elua_int_descriptor;

    *platform_int.c* must have an array of *elua_int_descriptor* types named
   *elua_int_table* (remember to make it *const* to save RAM). The elements
   of this array must be in the same order as the interrupt sources. The
   interrupt table for the example from step 1 above might look like this:

   const elua_int_descriptor elua_int_table[ INT_ELUA_LAST ] =
   {
     { int_gpio_posedge_set_status, int_gpio_posedge_get_status,
int_gpio_posedge_get_flag },
     { int_gpio_negedge_set_status, int_gpio_negedge_get_status,
int_gpio_negedge_get_flag },

     { int_tmr_match_set_status, int_tmr_match_get_status,
int_tmr_match_get_flag }
   };

    4.

   *Implement the init function*

   *platform_int.c* should implement a function named
*platform_int_init*(defined in
   *inc/platform.h*) that must initialize all the required hardware and the
   internal data structures of the interrupt subsystem. This function should be
   called from *platform_init*.
   5.

   *Implement the interrupt handlers*

   There are two simple requirements for the interrupt handlers: clear the
   hardware interrupt flag (if needed) and call *cmn_int_handler* (*
   src/common.c*) to connect the handler with the *eLua* interrupt code. An
   example is given below:

   // EINT3 (INT_GPIO) interrupt handler
   static void int_handler_eint3()
   {
     elua_int_id id = ELUA_INT_INVALID_INTERRUPT;
     pio_code resnum = 0;
     int pidx, pin;

     EXTINT |= 1 &lt;&lt; EINT3_BIT; // clear interrupt

     // Look for interrupt source
     // In can only be GPIO0/GPIO2, as the EXT interrupts are not (yet) used
     pidx = ( IO_INT_STAT &amp; 1 ) ? 0 : 1;
     if( *posedge_status[ pidx ] )
     {
       id = INT_GPIO_POSEDGE;

       pin = intlog2( *posedge_status[ pidx ] );
     }
     else
     {
       id = INT_GPIO_NEGEDGE;
       pin = intlog2( *negedge_status[ pidx ] );
     }
     resnum = PLATFORM_IO_ENCODE( pidx * 2, pin, PLATFORM_IO_ENC_PIN );

    * *intclr_regs[ pidx ] = 1 &lt;&lt; pin*;

     // Run the interrupt through eLua
     *cmn_int_handler( id, resnum )*;
     VICVectAddr = 0; // ACK interrupt

   }


That&#8217;s it. If you followed all these steps correctly, your platform should
be fully able to support interrupt handlers (as described here). Check the *
lpc24xx* platform implementation (*src/platform/lpc24xx*) for a full
example.
Interrupt list and naming conventions

To ensure maximum portability and correct system behaviour, interrupt names
(as defined in *platform_conf.h*) *must* follow a well-defined naming
pattern. Please note that this isn&#8217;t merely a convention, many times the
names must be properly chosen for the system to work properly. For example,
the timer interrupt match will never happen on virtual timers if the timer
interrupt match name isn&#8217;t *INT_TMR_MATCH* (see here for more details on how
to use the timer match interrupt).

The naming rule is that the interrupt name must have the format *
INT_&lt;peripheral&gt;_&lt;type&gt;_*, where:

   -

   *peripheral* is a symbolic name of the peripheral to which the interrupt
   applies.
   -

   *type* is a symbolic name of the interrupt type.

This restriction applies only to interrupt *names*. The value associated
with the interrupt name (as defined in *platform_conf.h*) can vary from
platform to platform, as long as it follows the rules outlined in step 1
above.

The table below lists all the valid interrupt names currently known to *eLua
*. If you add a new interrupt don&#8217;t forget to update the table below.
   Name  Meaning

*INT_GPIO_POSEDGE*

Interrupt on a positive edge on a GPIO pin

*INT_GPIO_NEGEDGE*

Interrupt on a negative edge on a GPIO pin

*INT_TMR_MATCH*

Interrupt on timer match

*INT_UART_RX*

Interrupt on UART character received
