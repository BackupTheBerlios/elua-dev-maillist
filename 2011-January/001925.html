<PRE>&gt;<i> The PX00-39 names have no correspondance in hardware. &#160;They are only
</I>&gt;<i> names used by Atmel to refer to everything except PA PB and PC 0-5
</I>&gt;<i> In reality, and in the code implementation, they are a bizzare
</I>&gt;<i> sequence of inverted pin ranges on the 32-bit C and D ports, and these
</I>&gt;<i> are the codes used internally in eLua so there is no extra
</I>&gt;<i> implementaion stuff. &#160;They are just human-readable names.
</I>&gt;<i> The PX00-39 names are only the names that human beings use for these
</I>&gt;<i> extra pins, for some strange capriccio of Atmel.
</I>
I said it before and I'll say it again: I _really_ want to meet
someone from Atmel who worked on the AVR32 and ask him what they're
smoking there ...

&gt;<i> So, what I did is make these names work for human beings in eLua
</I>&gt;<i> pio.PX_* syntax, mapping them to the actual port/pin values.
</I>&gt;<i> Internally, these are stored as port/pin pairs in a single integer: 5
</I>&gt;<i> bits for the pin and the rest for the port number.
</I>&gt;<i> By coincidence, this exactly coincides with Atmel's second alternative
</I>&gt;<i> scheme for referring to the pins, their &quot;GPIO numbers&quot; 0-109.
</I>
Which is what makes your patch functional in the first place (in took
me a while to figure this out): it maps directly to eLua's internal
representation by coincidence :)

&gt;<i> The only cause for concern is if these pins need to be turned back
</I>&gt;<i> into human-readable form for printing, in which case the &quot;PX&quot; pins
</I>&gt;<i> would be printed as &quot;PC&quot; and &quot;PD&quot; according to the real pin location
</I>&gt;<i> in the hardware. If you can find somewhere in the eLua code where this
</I>&gt;<i> is done, it may be worth the trouble to re-map these pins back to the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;PX&quot; names.
</I>&gt;<i> I don't remember seeing anywhere where this is done.
</I>
This isn't done in the code.

&gt;<i> The last thing is that the PORT name PX, used in some primitives to,
</I>&gt;<i> e.g. read or set all 32 pins simultaneously, is useless.
</I>&gt;<i> If you want to implement that, yes, you would need to change the
</I>&gt;<i> internal representation to handle 40-pin ports. &#160;However it is a
</I>&gt;<i> useless comcept on AVR32 because the usable GPIO pins are mixed up
</I>&gt;<i> with all the peripherals' pins and SDRAM data lines, which occupy most
</I>&gt;<i> of the actual port pins, leaving only 9 or 10 GPIO lines free in
</I>&gt;<i> random positions.
</I>
I see. OK, I agree: port operations on PX will not be allowed since it
is not a port at all.
I'll try to make all this into a patch that touches the
platform/common code rather than the PIO modue (much more elegant).

Best,
Bogdan
