It's probably a good moment to confess that I have no idea at all
about how to write a book, or how to be a good teacher in general. I
tend to go from 0 to way too technical faster than a Porsche; however,
people don't seem to like this as much as they like Porsches. This
didn't even worked for the brief period of time when I teached some
labs at the university, and those people were technical by definition
:<i>)
</I>That said I'd go with the approach suggested by James: start with
stuff than even a beginner could easily grasp (setting up the board,
running samples, on/off LEDs, switches, timers, UART + basic Lua
(variables, functions, tables, modules)) then gradually get more
advanced at user level (PWM, ADC, SPI, I2C, networking, remote file
systems + using advanced Lua concepts such as metatables or manual
control of the GC) and _maybe_ going very advanced, beyond user level
(modify the eLua configuration and recompile it, how to use the
platform interface to extend it, how write regular modules in C, how
to write dynamically loadable modules in C and so on). The latter part
might well stay in a wiki instead of the book itself, I have no idea
if it should be it the book (and it's not my decision anyway :) ).
Also I wouldn't include a datasheet. Not printed at least. I would
burn in to a CD that I'd sell with the book if I could figure out if a
CD is really needed.
One question: do you plan to make this a standalone computer or not?
My idea was to hook it to a VGA monitor or TV screen on one side and
to a PS/2 keyboard on the other side (maybe via an IR link or
something equally wireless) and use a simple but functional on-board
editor to write programs. It would be a pity if this thing would need
a PC to function.

Best,
Bogdan
