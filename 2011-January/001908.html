I don't know the state of LLVM's ARM backend support, but one big benefit of 
sLua compared to llvm-lua is that it generates pure C code that is as 
portable as the Lua VM core.  LLVM does have a backend for compiling it's IR 
into C code but by the time the IR gets compiled to C there are 
alignment/size issues, since the size of pointers/ints/longs and structure 
member alignment gets baked into the LLVM IR before the C backend codegen 
runs.  With some hacks I was able to fix the alignment issues and do a 
cross-compile of a Lua script for the iPhone (with the help of someone with a 
Mac &amp; iPhone).  But it was messy, which is one reason I started sLua.

</I>
The Lua bytecode will be more compact compared to the native code you get from 
static compiling it.  But the native code can be faster for somethings like 
loops.  The static compiler does a little bit of analysis (mostly detecting 
integer vs floating point numbers) to help the C compiler remove type checks 
and produce faster code.  sLua could do better at optimizing the code it 
generates, but I haven't had the time to add more code analysis.

The way llvm-lua &amp; sLua work is by compiling the Lua bytecodes for a Lua 
script into one function call for each bytecode (control structures like 
if/while/for/etc... require a bit more codegen work).  Using one function per 
VM opcode (some opcodes have extra specialized functions) was the simplest 
way to static compile Lua scripts.

For example a simple hello world script has 4 opcodes:
GETGLOBAL  0, -1 ; print
LOADK           1, -2 ; &quot;hello, world&quot;
CALL              0 2 1
RETURN         0 1

those opcodes basically get compiled to:
  vm_OP_GETGLOBAL(L, constants_list, closure, 0, 0);
  vm_OP_LOADK(L, constants_list, 1, 1);
  retval1 = vm_OP_CALL(L, 0, 2, 1);
  retval2 = vm_OP_RETURN(L, 0, 1);
  return retval2;

Those vm_OP_* functions are marked for inlining and they are included at the 
top of the generated C file:
#include &quot;lua_vm_ops.c&quot;

A good C compiler should be able to inline atleast some of the similar opcode 
functions and apply more optimizations based on the opcode's parameters.

At the start of each compiled Lua function is some setup code to get the 
current function's Lua closure for access to the functions UpValues &amp; 
constants.

Also it seems that I haven't finished implementing support for generating a 
loadable modules.  It looks like I just forgot to add the command line option 
to the compiler to have it generate the luaopen_&lt;mod_name&gt; function that is 
needed for a module.  I might be able to finish that tonight.

This method of static compiling Lua scripts might not be the best in terms of 
optimizations possibilities, but it was the simplest since it reuses the C 
code from the Lua VM code for those opcode functions.  Another way would be 
to create a new Lua compiler that either directly generates C code or 
compiles to a more high-level IR language that provide better information for 
code analysis &amp; optimization.
