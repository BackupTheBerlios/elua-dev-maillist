<PRE>Hi James

Thanks for offering direction on this.

It seems like the response to this is luke warm at best, I wonder if my 
idea is based on faulty principles.

I know these benchmarks are not always accurate but according to this:
<A HREF="http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/which-programming-languages-are-fastest.php">http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/which-programming-languages-are-fastest.php</A>

Vanilla Lua is about 31X slower then C, which in itself does not make 
total sense as LuaJit is supposed to be 2X to 4X faster then Lua but is 
ranked on this list as only 2X slower then C, which ought to make it 15X 
faster then Lua. Having said all this I would have expected that 
removing Lua from a final deployment would have speed things up at least 
2X and offered a similar reduction in memory allow for the final program 
to be loaded on reduced hardware and in turn saving costs.

I have not done much with serialization but I was thinking about 
serializing the L state struct and trying to reload it back without 
including the lua files. I am not even sure if this would work at all 
but if it did it might give me some idea of the savings of just having 
what is contained in L which I am assuming is not all of Lua itself but 
just some function pointers, the API stack and a registry, enough to 
make the C API work.

If this is all false could you rescue me from myself?

Thanks-Patrick
