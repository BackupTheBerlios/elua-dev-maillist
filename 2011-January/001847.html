</I>
I certainly can't claim to know any sort of &quot;secret&quot; to teaching, nor
have I done the curriculum for a class on my own.  My suggestions are
based on taking and TA'ing classes and also what I like to see in
documentation (I absolutely _love_ simple working examples that a user
can just paste in and start playing with :-) ).  A few other things on
the &quot;teaching&quot; front.

While in a class students might not like questions at the end of a
section describing something, since they often end up being homework,
I've heard from a number of people that they like having suggestions
at the end of a section for the reader to try implementing some
variations on what was just discussed.  I think this can be a good way
to give some general information, an example or two and then have the
user learn a bit about the system by trying to apply things. (i.e.: so
now you know how to turn LEDs on and off, now implement a function
that will make a binary display of a number you enter). I would be
careful with making too much of a jump between covered concepts and
these suggestions though (i.e.: they should neither be dumb nor almost
impossible for someone who is looking at this stuff for this first
time).

I also think the &quot;teaching by stealth&quot; approach should be nice as
well. I wouldn't make the language the focus, but rather what you can
do with it (teach by example).  Some things may require a bit of extra
explanation if they extend beyond calling functions and assigning
values to variables, but I would point them towards existing things
like PIL or LRM.

&gt;<i> That said I'd go with the approach suggested by James: start with
</I>&gt;<i> stuff than even a beginner could easily grasp (setting up the board,
</I>&gt;<i> running samples, on/off LEDs, switches, timers, UART + basic Lua
</I>&gt;<i> (variables, functions, tables, modules)) then gradually get more
</I>&gt;<i> advanced at user level (PWM, ADC, SPI, I2C, networking, remote file
</I>&gt;<i> systems + using advanced Lua concepts such as metatables or manual
</I>&gt;<i> control of the GC) and _maybe_ going very advanced, beyond user level
</I>&gt;<i> (modify the eLua configuration and recompile it, how to use the
</I>&gt;<i> platform interface to extend it, how write regular modules in C, how
</I>&gt;<i> to write dynamically loadable modules in C and so on). The latter part
</I>&gt;<i> might well stay in a wiki instead of the book itself, I have no idea
</I>&gt;<i> if it should be it the book (and it's not my decision anyway :) ).
</I>&gt;<i> Also I wouldn't include a datasheet. Not printed at least. I would
</I>&gt;<i> burn in to a CD that I'd sell with the book if I could figure out if a
</I>&gt;<i> CD is really needed.
</I>&gt;<i> One question: do you plan to make this a standalone computer or not?
</I>&gt;<i> My idea was to hook it to a VGA monitor or TV screen on one side and
</I>&gt;<i> to a PS/2 keyboard on the other side (maybe via an IR link or
</I>&gt;<i> something equally wireless) and use a simple but functional on-board
</I>&gt;<i> editor to write programs. It would be a pity if this thing would need
</I>&gt;<i> a PC to function.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best,
</I>&gt;<i> Bogdan
