I had forgotten about the string internalization issue, this is a good point.

Using something like LLVM as a static compiler was one thing I was
thinking of when reading through Patrick's proposal.  I thought of
mentioning llvm-lua, but from my understanding the ARM support for
MCUs isn't necessarily usable at this stage, although I believe I saw
some Thumb-2 support make it into LLVM during this last year.  I
suspect that one might get the greatest speed benefit by being able to
statically compile Lua into machine code, perhaps using LLVM as an
intermediate to get some optimization benefits.

One question about what you're describing though:
&quot;compiles lua scripts/bytecode into C code that uses the same internal
VM opcode instead of the Lua C API&quot;

I'm not completely clear on what advantages this has vs just using
luac to generate a loadable but pre-compiled Lua module?  I could see
in the case of eLua that we could maybe use this as another way to use
Lua code and keep things in flash rather than in RAM on the heap.  Are
there other advantages that aren't occurring to me?  From the readme
it also sounds like it can generate stand-alone executables, which I
would presume would allow one to save some space?

In any case, I'll be downloading and checking out slua :-)

Also, to Patrick:
As Bogdan was saying, we don't wish to discourage you from trying
things, crazy or not :-)  Sometimes the the only way to find out if
something is viable is to try.  I believe that there should be some
solution in the realm of what you're describing that would allow the
creation of more compact distributions, it might be that another tack
will get there more effectively.   Also, whether something works or
not, you learn a lot from digging around in the guts of things like
Lua, which can help a lot to shape future ideas and approaches.
