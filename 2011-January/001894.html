</I>&gt;&gt;<i> PLATFORM_IO_PIN_CLEAR );
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's wrong. &#160;SD_MMC_SPI_NPCS_PIN is a GPIO number 0-105.
</I>&gt;<i> It only happens to work here because the pin in question is on port 0.
</I>
I wouldn't call it 'wrong', it's just the way eLua works :) And the
model is inspired from the real world.This oddity (using GPIO pin
numbers instead of port/pin combination) is specific to AVR32, all the
other platforms have a GPIO subsystem that define both ports and pins.
Which is the same model eLua uses. Some platforms have 8 pins/port,
other have 32 pins/port, none has more than 32. Sure, having a single
port with 106 pins is a particular case of the port/pin model, but it
doesn't quite fit the eLua model for the reasons outlined in the
previous e-mail.

&gt;<i> It should be using macros to convert from GPIO pin number to port/pin number.
</I>
Maybe this is indeed what we should consider for AVR32 as a particular case.

&gt;<i> By coincidence, it's the same conversion as PLATFORM_IO_GET_PORT() and
</I>&gt;<i> PLATFORM_IO_GET_PIN(v) - but only by coincidence. &#160;I guess we need two
</I>&gt;<i> more (avr32-specific) macros to do this right.
</I>
Yes. BTW, PLATFORM_IO_GET_PIN doesn't work properly in this case since
it only uses 5 bits to encode a pin number. By extension, the other
macros that encode/decode ports/pins don't work either.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> From inc/platform.h:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pio_type platform_pio_op( unsigned port, pio_type pinmask, int op );
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> since PX has more than 32 pins we'd have to change that to a 64 bit unsigned
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In hardware, PX does not exist; it's just a strange Atmel naming
</I>&gt;<i> convention for pins on ports 2 and 3.
</I>
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that we won't be able to read/write the value of PX as a whole
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can't read/write PX as a whole, simply because it doesn't exist!
</I>
I understand you very well, I'm just trying to find a way to map the
AVR32 model to the &quot;rest of the world&quot; model (I know this is an
untasteful generalization, but up to this point experience seems to
suggest that it is real :) ). The &quot;rest of the world&quot; model contains
functions for reading/writing ports as a whole (8/32 bits at a time,
depending on the platform) which is much faster than setting
individual pins. Imagine that you have a small graphical LCD (128x64
and alike) with an 8-bit interface connected to your GPIO pins.
Settings pins individually to control this works but can be very slow.
Doing it at port level might increase speed significantly.
However, this gives me an idea of &quot;ranges&quot; that one could use as a
generalization for GPIO functionality. Something like this:

range = gpio.range( 0, 7 ) -- initialize a GPIO range for pins 0 to 7 of a prt
range.add( 9 ) -- add pin 9 to range
range.add( 12, 14 ) -- add pins 12, 13, 14 to range

gpio.set( range, 0 ) - clear all pins in range (ideally in a single operation)
gpio.set( range, 1 ) - set all pins in range (ideally in a single operation)
v = gpio.get( range ) - read all pins in range in variable 'v'

This extended model could cover even the AVR32 case properly and might
eliminate the need for the concept of 'ports' completely.

&gt;<i> You can read ports 2 and 3 separately and mix the bits up to maintain
</I>&gt;<i> the illusion that port X exists.
</I>&gt;<i> I wouldn't bother making life so difficult for so little (no) gain.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't expect many problems for this if we document it properly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Extra complexity is always a problem. In fact, in computing, managing
</I>&gt;<i> complexity is *the* problem.
</I>
I couldn't agree with you more, and this is exactly what I'm trying to
avoid here. I chose the port/pin model initially because it was fit
for most eLua targets (and still is) so it was the easiest to
implement. I'm trying to avoid extra complexity by mapping AVR32 over
the same model (while at the same time trying not to loose
funcionality (like getport/setport)) instead of handling special cases
for specific platforms. True, I'm not doing it very well :) so it
might seem that I'm increasing complexity while I'm trying to do the
exact opposite.

Best,
Bogdan
