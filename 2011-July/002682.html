</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yep, sorry for complicating things a bit. &#160;As far as the PWM stuff

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> modifying that should go under another thread (resurrecting an earlier
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> discussion or tracker issue).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; in order:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; - turning the _op primitives into separate functions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; The _op primitives seem to be imitating the ioctl() system call.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; However, the ioctl system call, with hundreds of &quot;operations&quot; and a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; single pointer parameter, was designed to collect hundreds of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; different device-specific functions without having to have hundreds of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; new system calls, and to allow the addition of new operations for new
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; hardware devices without having to change the system call interface
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; each time. In some Unix platforms the number of system calls is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; limited by the hardware/instruction set, so they were forced to put
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; hundreds of different functions through a single hole.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; eLua doesn't have that limitation, since functions are cheap and not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; limited in number. Having one C function per operation also makes the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; documentation clearer, since each operation has its own paragraph
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; instead of trying to document 6 different things mixed together.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I assume there's no objection to turning these into separate functions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; where possible.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Bogdan may or may not object to doing that in other places. I think
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the reasons you have laid out, especially for ADC are pretty
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> compelling.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; - allowing more precise low sampling frequencies like Etna's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; seismographs at 27.27Hz, for ADC (and I guess PWM).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I agree with not making floating point mandatory because one of eLua's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; design objectives is to run on embedded platforms where code size can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; be critical, and the floating point emulator adds 50K to the code
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; size.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> At the end of the day, I think this is mainly what needs to remain
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> consistent.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Indeed. &#160;My only point here is that so far we've intentionally kept
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; types that are defined by Lua out of the platform layer so that they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; don't depend on Lua itself.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Is that so that the C platform layer can be more easily re-used, say
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; as the platform-driver layer for a different language, or in custom
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; applications?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm not sure what Dado and Bogdan might have to say on the matter, but

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160;At certain points I've wanted to investigate the work that might be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> involved in separating out the lower level API and maybe build system
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as a multiplatform hardware abstraction layer that would make it easy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to build C applications or use other VMs on top of the platform
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interface (like PyMite/Python-on-a-Chip) for example. &#160;Even if one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> isn't interested in Lua per-se the project does provide working
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> examples of how to build with open toolchains across a variety of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> platforms. &#160;I'd like it if we can keep this flexibility.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes. Personally I would prefer to have an independent, generic and as
</I>&gt;<i> portable as possible platform layer. Marcelo Politzer and Thiago Naves
</I>&gt;<i> (@LedLab) have been experimenting with this concept and extending
</I>&gt;<i> implementations to other targets but some implementation details have been
</I>&gt;<i> making it harder.
</I>&gt;<i> It would be nice to hear them here for some more details, in a different
</I>&gt;<i> thread.
</I>&gt;<i> I would love to be able to use the platform layer for C-only applications.
</I>&gt;<i> It is certainly possible to do it today but not in an easy way IMHO.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; There are two ways I can think of that could remain exclusively
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; integer:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 1) Passing optional divisors. &#160;For PWM, at one point, I suggested that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; we could allow finer resolution duty cyles by allowing other fractions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; than per cent such as /1000 (per mil) or 10000 (per basis point).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Clock frequencies could have this as well, either fixed or arbitrary
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; divisors passed as a parameter.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I sort of like this idea - using an optional extra parameter in Lua
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; which by default would be 100 (for percent) for duty cycles.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; The PWM setup function is currently:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; frequency = pwm.setup(id, frequency, duty_cycle)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; and, as far as duty cycle goes, this is OK, since it is the last
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; parameter, but it does nothing for frequencies unless we add two
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; optional parameters as divisors with default values of 100 and 1. Or 1
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; and 100.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It would need some adaptation for frequencies, since the values one is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> using are generally greater than 1 Hz, so the divisors would likely be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> smaller (or arbitrary). &#160;I haven't thought through an implementation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to decide which would be easier.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When you say two optional parameters are you meaning two different
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> values that could be placed in a divisor parameter, or multiple
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> additional parameters? &#160;I would be thinking of essentially having two
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> parameters, the first being the numerator, the latter being the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> divisor with a default value of 1 if not passed. &#160;If the user passes a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> divisor then the platform will attempt to match the fractional
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> frequency as closely as hardware allows.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 2) Something similar to POSIX's timer API
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; POSIX is not a manual of good interface design. It was born as an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; attempt to unite the different ways that manufacturers had extended
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; the original Unix kernel interfaces. All the new stuff since then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; comes from design-by-committee, which usually produces awful
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; interfaces. Google POSIX timer API.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Well, I don't mean to actually _implement_ the posix timer API, merely
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> borrow the concept of second sized ticks, and mircosecond sized ticks
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as a compound value/structure or multiple parameters that could be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> passed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There's some horrible stuff in the POSIX API due to munging of various
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implementations together that you mention plus some things were
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> clearly meant for different purposes in a different time, like POSIX
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> RS-323 support, but I've come to appreciate it over dealing with some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Win32 API stuff that just feels baroque by comparison.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; which allows specification
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; of a low and higher resolution component. &#160;i.e.: integer Hz + integer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &#181;Hz or nHz. &#160;This came up a while ago, and wasn't for setting clock
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; frequencies, more for timer intervals, but one could use it for clock
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; frequencies as well. &#160;So that you would define that you wanted 27 Hz +
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 270000 &#181;Hz or something similar
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Just a few thoughts. &#160;In some ways the gymnastics necessary for the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; user, interface implementer, and backend implementer start making the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; floating point version sound appealing :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Not if floating point becomes necessary, since that goes against the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;embedded&quot; objective of eLua.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm definitely not suggesting tossing integer eLua :-) &#160;While most of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the builds I use may be floating point ones, none of the platforms I'm
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> using even have hardware FP, and there's a steep cost in code size.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I only suggested that for when FP is already enabled in Lua.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; If it isn't, the user has no way to express a floating point value
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; from Lua anyway, or to receive an FP value back.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Right. &#160;Essentially the function for setting frequency would take a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lua_Number (or something like it) and the code on the backend would be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> carefully written to work with both floating point and integer builds.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; What's the lesser of these evils:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; - no way to express low frequencies with precision, limited PWM duty
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; cycle resolution (current situation)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; - higher precision in the FP version of Lua, lower precision in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; integer one, for duty cycles and low frequencies
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; - interfaces in Lua and C that express floating point values as some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; combination of integers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is the tough question. Generally I would be trying to minimize
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pain for implementation and ugliness in the interface I think.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> +1
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160;The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> divisor/fraction stuff doesn't actually sound too bad to me,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> especially if it's done as an optional parameter with a default that's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the same as current behavior. &#160;This way users can blithely ignore the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> functionality, and current code continues to work, but even the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> integer port can define non-integer frequencies.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It does have one other complication, which is what do we return as the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> actual frequency acquired, especially on the integer port. &#160;I suppose
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it should be in the form passed, with two returned values, the first
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> being the numerator and the second being the denominator. &#160;This
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wouldn't break existing code, and those who just receive one value
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would get just the numerator, plus we can still tell them, with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reasonable accuracy, what frequency they got.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Anyone else have opinions here?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can't say now if this is the best final solution, in the sense that it
</I>&gt;<i> should be adopted for similar needs in the future too. But it sounds like an
</I>&gt;<i> elegant and simple solution, although the return-value issue will seem
</I>&gt;<i> pretty strange on the higher level. But I can't think of anything better
</I>&gt;<i> now, without forcing some major refactoring on the platform layer.
</I>
The fundamental issue there is returning a potentially non-integer
frequency through integer values, since they've been requested using
integer numerator and denominator.  The are some possible restrictions
that could be placed on the values returned:
1) for cases where the divisor is 1 or not provided, the returned
divisor will always be 1 (to preserve existing behavior, even if the
returned frequency can't precisely be represented as an integer value)

For all other cases there are two options:
2) Always use the same divisor as passed in.  In some ways this sounds
a bit stupid to return the divisor in this case, but I think I prefer
the idea that the units of the return value can be interpreted without
having to refer to the passed values.  The biggest downside to this is
that there's a potential loss of precision if the divisor doesn't
match up well with the actual clock frequency.

3) The divisor returned is determined by the low-level code in order
to provide best accuracy in conveying the frequency selected given the
available variable size for storing the values. Optionally, the low
level implementor can use the same divisor originally passed.  This
would potentially allow providing the highest fidelity in conveying
the frequency selected, and it might also be the easiest way to make
this work given that you could probably just base the values directly
on the main system clock, divisors applied to that, and the timer
reload value and you provide the precise fraction for the clock
frequency.

As a potential additional option, 1) could be revised such that if no
divisor is passed, return divisor is always 1, but if a 1 is passed
than the divisor is allowed to float as in 3) above.  This would
provide consistency with current behavior and maximum potential return
value accuracy.

With either of these, determination of the clock frequency on a
floating point MCU is one division operation away.  On integer units,
some more complex math would need to be employed to ensure the
fraction is within desired tolerances.


As far as rethinking the API is concerned, I think either way we come
back to an issue of fractional frequencies with integer expressions
problem, unless the integer builds are to have different functionality
than the floating point builds.
