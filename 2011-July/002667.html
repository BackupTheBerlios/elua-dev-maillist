So, are you suggesting changing it so that it could be expressed in
floating point or fixed point units as well?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Changing it to lua_Number
</I>
One thing we should keep in mind is making sure that such a change
should work for both integer and floating point versions of eLua.
Also, so far we don't pass any lua types or floating point types
through the platform interface.

This also brings up the issue of non-integer PWM percentages...

&gt;<i> and making the associated changes in each

</I>&gt;<i> six of the adc functions, including adc.setclock(), all go through
</I>&gt;<i> platform_adc_op() which forces the parameters and return values of six
</I>&gt;<i> different functions to be of the same type, u32, whereas in reality
</I>&gt;<i> they are of different types:
</I>&gt;<i> GET_MAXVAL takes nothing and returns an ADC conversion value
</I>&gt;<i> SET_SMOOTHING takes a power-of-two filter length and returns nothing
</I>&gt;<i> SET_BLOCKING takes a boolean and returns nothing
</I>&gt;<i> IS_DONE takes nothing and returns a boolean
</I>&gt;<i> SET_TIMER takes a timer ID and returns nothing
</I>&gt;<i> SET_CLOCK takes a frequency in Hz and returns a frequency in Hz.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The six module functions, adc_getmaxval() and so on, each do their own
</I>&gt;<i> thing for their parameters, then call platform_asdc_op() with a
</I>&gt;<i> different constant &quot;operation&quot; parameter, then platform_adc_op just
</I>&gt;<i> examines the &quot;operation&quot; parameter and does six different, unrelated
</I>&gt;<i> things.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can't see an advantage to uniting these six functions at the C
</I>&gt;<i> platform interface and attach a patch to make them six separate
</I>&gt;<i> functions, which also makes the documentation simpler and clearer. It
</I>&gt;<i> should also be very slightly faster and saves 26 bytes of code :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If this seems like a good idea to other people, can someone review
</I>&gt;<i> these changes and check that they work on a platform with a full ADC
</I>&gt;<i> implementation?
</I>
On this front, probably fair enough.  When I wrote the platform
interface I was following the other platform interfaces which used the
_op function, which is similar to a lot of POSIX functionality.

I can try applying this on one or two platforms and see if it works for me.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also noticed that the SET_FREERUNNING primitive is undocumented and
</I>&gt;<i> is never called from anywhere, although a lot of platform code checks
</I>&gt;<i> the value of s-&gt;freerunning (which I guess is always 0). &#160;Is this a
</I>&gt;<i> work in progress awaiting completion?
</I>
It was something that I implemented, but there wasn't popular support
for.  Essentially, if I recall, what it would do would be constantly
write into the ring buffer and expire values even if they hadn't been
picked up so that you would always get fresh data.  Right now I don't
recall whether it simply requires setting the option to make it work
or if it's broken.  I think it likely still works, there's just not
way to turn it on and off at the moment.  If nobody wants it, I guess
we can remove it.
