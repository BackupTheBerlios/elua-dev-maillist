Sorry, I obviously wasn't very clear in my explanation.
I'm trying to distinguish what seem to be three different types of
data object in the platform interface that have have different
characteristics and require differ kinds of reasoning about them:
1. clock frequencies derived from a crystal, that are used in
pwm.setclock(), tmr.setclock() and elsewhere;
2. frequencies that are derived from these by dividing these down,
usually with a hardware counter that resets every N clock cycles, as
used in adc sampling rates, pwm output frequencies(), free-running
timer interrupts and so on.

I just used the words &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; because their typical ranges of
frequencies are higher and lower.
Shall we call then &quot;clocking frequencies&quot; and &quot;output frequencies&quot; or
something, to avoid the subjective associations of the words &quot;high&quot;
and &quot;low&quot;?

By separating the different cases, we can reason more usefully about
each one, rather than talking about a single solution to three
different types of object.

It may be that what I have called &quot;low&quot; frequencies are not worth
making more precise, which would just leave PWM duty cycles.

&gt;<i>&#160;PWM can
</I>&gt;<i> certainly run at a few megahertz on many of the platforms we use,
</I>&gt;<i> though this doesn't provide excellent resolution in duty cycle.
</I>
As well as 1 or 2 hertz if used to flash christmas lights, where one
would be able to produce a slowly-accelerating flashing rate.
What I mean, again, is that these are lower frequencies derived from
the clocking rate.  Of course, the divisor used to produce the output
frequency could even be 1, giving the same frequency as the clock
rate, but in terms of the program interface, that data object is still
an output frequency derived from the clocking frequency.

&gt;<i> I actually have a minor dislike for the convention of the &quot;setup&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> function since they take different parameters depending on the
</I>&gt;<i> peripheral that's being setup.
</I>
I have no problem aith that, since different devices need setting up
with different parameters.
For me, if the function sets the interface up (i.e. initializes it to
make it ready for subsequent use), then &quot;setup&quot; is OK.
I am concerned by a *.setup() function that doesn't set the interface
up, but is used to drive it!

&gt;<i>&#160;As far as alternatives, maybe something like settimer
</I>&gt;<i> or setuptimer might make more sense? &#160;Alternately if we wanted ADC to
</I>&gt;<i> support other trigger sources, it could be named something like
</I>&gt;<i> settrigger or setuptrigger?
</I>
OK, I'll leave you to think about that. I'm happy as long as
foo.setup() sets foo up ready to be used, foo.setclock() sets foo's
clock frequency and so on, so that when you read the Lua code, it
makes some kind of sense.

&gt;<i> &gt; Furthermore, on AVR32, being told to set both the frequency and duty
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cycle causes a glitch in the output because the stupid hardware
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interface can only set either the frequency or the duty cycle once per
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; output cycle so you get one cycle either at the new frequency and old
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; duty cycle or at the old frequency with the new duty cycle.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Interesting. &#160;I assume that you can temporarily stop the peripheral,
</I>&gt;<i> set the values and then start it again though? &#160;Sure you might lose
</I>&gt;<i> some clock cycles, but I'm not sure we're guaranteeing that PWM is
</I>&gt;<i> continuous through successive calls. &#160;Not sure if we would need to do
</I>&gt;<i> so either.
</I>
The most demanding application I can think of is when it is being used
to signal data, such as in TV remote controls, where a blip at the
wrong frequency or duty cycle might make it do the wrong thing. Yes,
you can also stop the output, reprogram it and start again, though for
applications like using PWM to implement an audio DAC, that causes an
audible bubble in the output. I like producing good quality output
when that is possible, so that when people push the envelope, the
system doesn't let them down.

&gt;<i> &gt; Worse yet, pwm.setup(id, frequency, duty_cycle) takes two parameters
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; both of which are in the proposed fixed-point format, which is ugly.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Even in the naive case where you get higher precision by giving a duty
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cycle radix of 1000 or 1000000, you'd need to supply a bogus extra
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; parameter for the undesired precision of the PWM output frequency.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is another reason why I'm not a massive fan of &quot;setup&quot; functions,
</I>&gt;<i> I kindof think this should be two separate functions.
</I>
OK

&gt;<i> Would we really need a radix other than 1 for PWM frequencies though?
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure if non-integer frequencies are ever needed.
</I>
Flashing christmas lights?

&gt;<i> &gt; These are three arguments in favour of splitting pwm.setup() into two
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; functions like pwm.setfreq() and pwm.setduty(). &#160;A fourth is that all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the other modules' setup() functions are usually called once at start
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of program, then the output is varied as the program runs using
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; module-specific functions, whereas the current pwm.setup() is used
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; repeatedly while the programming is running to vary the output.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, I've felt this way for a while now. &#160;Bogdan, any comments on
</I>&gt;<i> this front? We're starting to get into a number of API changes and
</I>&gt;<i> proposals here :-)
</I>
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 3) The divisor returned is determined by the low-level code in order
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; to provide best accuracy in conveying the frequency selected given the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; available variable size for storing the values.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Trying to select the most precise pair of integers to represent an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; arbitrary value is actually quite a difficult math-theoretical
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problem, not to mention the difficullty in the user code that would be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; necessary to correctly handle them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is true. &#160;It's an optimization problem. &#160;There are some simple
</I>&gt;<i> single-shot approaches that have what are most likely acceptable error
</I>&gt;<i> levels like the one mentioned earlier. &#160;Really choosing things
</I>&gt;<i> optimally is harder and is iterative unless one has a lookup table.
</I>&gt;<i> I'd be OK with selecting one that's not perfect, but could be adjusted
</I>&gt;<i> a little to provide low error in the ranges that the peripherals are
</I>&gt;<i> generally used.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't mean to say that they really need to be optimal, we would end
</I>&gt;<i> up wasting computational time and memory with some iterative
</I>&gt;<i> optimization algorithm or lookup tables. &#160;The reason that I said
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;maximum _potential_ return value accuracy&quot; was that this would give
</I>&gt;<i> the backend implementer the most precise representation of the
</I>&gt;<i> frequency the user wanted. &#160;Again, I would be happy with a simple
</I>&gt;<i> non-iterative algorithm with a known worst-case that is acceptable.
</I>
I would drop this idea and keep it simple, returning values in the
same radix as the user passed, where that is appropriate.

Or, if we drop the proposal to make &quot;output&quot; frequencies more precise
(for the 27.27Hz ADCs in seismographs and for the xmas lights), that
only leaves PWM duty cycles, and in that case we don't return the
&quot;actual&quot; duty cycle set at all, so the problem goes away.

&gt;<i>&#160;I would tend to agree that just
</I>&gt;<i> going with fixed-point (powers of 10) might be the least messy to deal
</I>&gt;<i> with.
</I>
I have no problem if they want to express something in 360ths for some
reason of their own, or, in units of the period of the PWM cycle
counter to get max precision. Our code would be the same in any case,
without needing to impose artificial restrictions.

Can we focus on concrete proposals and decide?

I'm in favour of adding optional extra parameter after duty cycles to
get higher precision (indeed, hardware precision if you pick the right
radix)

I'm ambivalent about adding radix to frequencies for higher-precision
low frequencies. It would be nice.

Lastly, these kinds of changes are hard because they have to be
implemented on every platform simultaneously, which either needs
someone who has all the platforms, or some tight collaboration.
James, have you been able to test on an ARm platform that patch to
split platform_adc_op()
