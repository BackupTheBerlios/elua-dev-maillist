</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is already an industry convention for passing floating point
</I>&gt;<i> values as integers. It's called fixed point arithmetic, and that is
</I>&gt;<i> already in use in eLua: time delays are fixed-point with radix 1000000

</I>
Right, perhaps with a range of radices that make sense for the
application, since using microseconds would be overkill and would
limit sampling rates to the kilohertz range with 32-bit integers, I
think.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In eLua we have three separate usage cases of arbitrary numbers being
</I>&gt;<i> passed/returned as integers:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. high frequencies for clocks, used in PWM clock, timer clock (also
</I>&gt;<i> used in ADC), maybe also for I2C and SPI clocks and (even more maybe)
</I>&gt;<i> UART baud rates.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. low frequencies for ADC sampling rates and PWM frequencies
</I>
These don't have to be low frequencies unless hundreds of kilohertz or
an order of magnitude higher is considered low :-)  Of course, the
distinction is relative and for the most part, especially for ADC, I
would expect sampling rates to be low given the rate of bytecode
execution in Lua and the cost of doing operations on samples.  PWM can
certainly run at a few megahertz on many of the platforms we use,
though this doesn't provide excellent resolution in duty cycle.  That
said, higher frequencies can be convenient when you want to use it as
a cheap DAC with an LPF, or to even generate audio.

&gt;<i> 3. duty cycles for PWM
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let's look at these:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The high frequencies already seem precise enough to me for our
</I>&gt;<i> purposes, since they're in the 100,000s and 1,000,000, already giving
</I>&gt;<i> a precision of 1 part in 100.000 except for baud rates, but I've only
</I>&gt;<i> ever seen integer baud rates, and with a minimum of 110. Checking the
</I>&gt;<i> actual baud rate that was set and caring about whether it is &#160;less
</I>&gt;<i> than 0.5% different is Book 3 stuff, not really a design goal for eLua
</I>&gt;<i> if it will make things more complicated.
</I>
I would agree.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The resolution of the clock that the low frequencies depend on is
</I>&gt;<i> already returned by their setclock() (or setup()) functions, which
</I>&gt;<i> return the actual frequency set. This may be very different from the
</I>&gt;<i> one requested, often a power-of-two divisor of some fixed system clock
</I>&gt;<i> rate, still in the 100,000s or 1,000,000s range.
</I>
Yep.  Some platforms probably could do frequency matching a little
better, depending on whether there are multiple divisors that can be
mixed to generate the clock, but that's a separate issue that depends
on the platform.  When I've noticed that there are deficiencies of
this sort, I've attempted to improve it.  stm32, for example, was
adjusting only one clock divisor to get its frequencies which both
limited the range (couldn't go below around 1Khz) and limited the
resolution of the selectable frequencies.  There are established
routines, sometimes provided by the vendor, for properly selecting
clocks that should be used when finer integer resolution in clocks is
important.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [[[
</I>&gt;<i> As a separate issue, I notice that there is a function in the ADC
</I>&gt;<i> module, also called setclock, that does something different from the
</I>&gt;<i> other setclock() functions.
</I>&gt;<i> i2c, spi and tmr.setclock() all set their own underlying hardware
</I>&gt;<i> independently of each other, and they all have a setclock() function
</I>&gt;<i> that works the same way as the others (nice!).
</I>&gt;<i> adc.setclock() is different: it sets a lower frequency sampling rate
</I>&gt;<i> based on a number of cycles of a chosen timer. The user can find the
</I>&gt;<i> real frequency of the timer in question, since they can called
</I>&gt;<i> tmr.setclock() (or tmr.getclock()) on the timer they are associating
</I>&gt;<i> with the adc channel.
</I>&gt;<i> I suggest adc.setclock() be renamed to something different, since it's
</I>&gt;<i> a different function with different parameters from the other
</I>&gt;<i> setclock() functions. In fact, it's more similar in what it does to
</I>&gt;<i> the other modules' *.setup() functions.
</I>&gt;<i> ]]]
</I>
This is a good point.  It does multiple things... It configures the
ADC to trigger on the timer passed, and then sets up a timer so that
it has a period close to the requested clock.  Setup might be OK, but
I actually have a minor dislike for the convention of the &quot;setup&quot;
function since they take different parameters depending on the
peripheral that's being setup. For consistency sake this would make
sense though.  As far as alternatives, maybe something like settimer
or setuptimer might make more sense?  Alternately if we wanted ADC to
support other trigger sources, it could be named something like
settrigger or setuptrigger?

Ideally, maybe the tmr module could be adapted so that it's functions
could be used to set up the period, and then the ADC function could
just ensure that the ADC would trigger on match (or whatever event it
can use from the timer).  Besides some special configuration for
timers to sometimes generate events or certain things like that, the
current tmr API doesn't lend itself to configuring cycle durations.
One could add another function, similar to set_match_int, or adapt
set_match_int/rename it to allow it to configure hardware peripheral
triggers in addition to interrupts.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the last case, the duty cycles' true precision is the period of one
</I>&gt;<i> cycle of the PWM waveform expressed in PWM clock cycles. That
</I>&gt;<i> information is available to the user through pwm.setclock() and
</I>&gt;<i> getclock() interfaces.
</I>&gt;<i> However, the underlying granularity of the available duty cycles as a
</I>&gt;<i> fraction of the PWM wave period changes whenever you change the PWM
</I>&gt;<i> frequency.
</I>&gt;<i> Users who want to get the maximum precision from their PWM duty cycle
</I>&gt;<i> will need to do some interesting math coding to achieve this, but it
</I>&gt;<i> should be possible.
</I>
As I was mentioning before, there are some established/recommended
routines that vendors provide for doing things like this.  For STM32,
for example, we do the following for PWM and I think ADC frequencies:

period = (base peripheral clock) / desired_clock;
prescaler = ( period / 65536 ) + 1;
period = period/prescaler;

period (automatic reload value) and prescaler are then set to
registers after subtracting 1.

The resulting clock can then be computed as:
(base peripheral clock) / prescaler / period

With a 32 MHz clock this gives error along these lines along with
minimum step sizes (100/period)
<A HREF="http://i.imgur.com/YwqB8.png">http://i.imgur.com/YwqB8.png</A>

This is a little platform specific in terms of register sizes and max
prescaler sizes, but something similar could be adapted for most
platforms.

&gt;<i> The Lua code to do that would be good as an
</I>&gt;<i> advanced example in the eLua manual. Such power users would need to
</I>&gt;<i> figure out the period in clock cycles of the PWM at the actual
</I>&gt;<i> frequency that was set, then set the duty cycle with a radix that is
</I>&gt;<i> equal to that. That is awkward in the current pwm.setup() function,
</I>&gt;<i> since it takes duty cycle and frequency at the same time, so they'd
</I>&gt;<i> have to call it twice, once with the wrong duty cycle and once with
</I>&gt;<i> the right one once you've found out the actual PWM frequency.
</I>
I think it would be nice to show how to do the manual approach from
Lua and to maybe make the interface a little less awkward.  I also
like making the default behavior one that doesn't require that the
user write an algorithm to set PWM up as long as we can do a pretty
good job automatically.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Furthermore, on AVR32, being told to set both the frequency and duty
</I>&gt;<i> cycle causes a glitch in the output because the stupid hardware
</I>&gt;<i> interface can only set either the frequency or the duty cycle once per
</I>&gt;<i> output cycle so you get one cycle either at the new frequency and old
</I>&gt;<i> duty cycle or at the old frequency with the new duty cycle.
</I>
Interesting.  I assume that you can temporarily stop the peripheral,
set the values and then start it again though?  Sure you might lose
some clock cycles, but I'm not sure we're guaranteeing that PWM is
continuous through successive calls.  Not sure if we would need to do
so either.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Worse yet, pwm.setup(id, frequency, duty_cycle) takes two parameters
</I>&gt;<i> both of which are in the proposed fixed-point format, which is ugly.
</I>&gt;<i> Even in the naive case where you get higher precision by giving a duty
</I>&gt;<i> cycle radix of 1000 or 1000000, you'd need to supply a bogus extra
</I>&gt;<i> parameter for the undesired precision of the PWM output frequency.
</I>
This is another reason why I'm not a massive fan of &quot;setup&quot; functions,
I kindof think this should be two separate functions.

Would we really need a radix other than 1 for PWM frequencies though?
I'm not sure if non-integer frequencies are ever needed.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These are three arguments in favour of splitting pwm.setup() into two
</I>&gt;<i> functions like pwm.setfreq() and pwm.setduty(). &#160;A fourth is that all
</I>&gt;<i> the other modules' setup() functions are usually called once at start
</I>&gt;<i> of program, then the output is varied as the program runs using
</I>&gt;<i> module-specific functions, whereas the current pwm.setup() is used
</I>&gt;<i> repeatedly while the programming is running to vary the output.
</I>
Yeah, I've felt this way for a while now.  Bogdan, any comments on
this front? We're starting to get into a number of API changes and
proposals here :-)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3) The divisor returned is determined by the low-level code in order
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to provide best accuracy in conveying the frequency selected given the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> available variable size for storing the values.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Trying to select the most precise pair of integers to represent an
</I>&gt;<i> arbitrary value is actually quite a difficult math-theoretical
</I>&gt;<i> problem, not to mention the difficullty in the user code that would be
</I>&gt;<i> necessary to correctly handle them.
</I>
This is true.  It's an optimization problem.  There are some simple
single-shot approaches that have what are most likely acceptable error
levels like the one mentioned earlier.  Really choosing things
optimally is harder and is iterative unless one has a lookup table.
I'd be OK with selecting one that's not perfect, but could be adjusted
a little to provide low error in the ranges that the peripherals are
generally used.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As a potential additional option, 1) could be revised such that if no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> divisor is passed, return divisor is always 1, but if a 1 is passed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than the divisor is allowed to float as in 3) above.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We already have the first part, and the defaults are 100 for the duty
</I>&gt;<i> cycle, 1,000,000 for delays and 1 for frequencies. &#160;I hink the second
</I>&gt;<i> idea is a nightmare for us and for the users.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> provide consistency with current behavior and maximum potential return
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> value accuracy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't value euther of these. On the one hand I'm not afraid to
</I>&gt;<i> change the platform (or the Lua) interfaces if that gives a worthwhile
</I>&gt;<i> improvement in what you can do or how easy it is to understand, and
</I>&gt;<i> the current interface did not consider the practical problems that we
</I>&gt;<i> are trying to improve now.
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;I seem to remember someone saying that, before we release eLua 1.0,
</I>&gt;<i> maintaining backward compatability is not a problem, especially given
</I>&gt;<i> the small user base. &#160;Of course, we don't want to break things for no
</I>&gt;<i> significant gain.
</I>
I could have worded that better, and I agree with what you just said
here, I believe I was just saying that it was a plus that it wouldn't
break existing functionality, which does have some value.

&gt;<i> &#160;I don't think total laboratory-standard mathematical accuracy is as
</I>&gt;<i> important a degisn goal for eLua as being simple to use and having an
</I>&gt;<i> Lua interface that is pleasant to use and easy to understand. &#160;It's a
</I>&gt;<i> design tradeoff, since lab accuracy requires a different set of
</I>&gt;<i> interfaces than one that is easy-to-use but adequate for most
</I>&gt;<i> purposes.
</I>
I don't mean to say that they really need to be optimal, we would end
up wasting computational time and memory with some iterative
optimization algorithm or lookup tables.  The reason that I said
&quot;maximum _potential_ return value accuracy&quot; was that this would give
the backend implementer the most precise representation of the
frequency the user wanted.  Again, I would be happy with a simple
non-iterative algorithm with a known worst-case that is acceptable.

&gt;<i> &#160;Already, moving to optional variable radix fixed point for some
</I>&gt;<i> values is a step towards higher accuracy and away from easy-to-use,
</I>&gt;<i> but seems to bring some advantages.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As far as rethinking the API is concerned, I think either way we come
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> back to an issue of fractional frequencies with integer expressions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problem, unless the integer builds are to have different functionality
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than the floating point builds.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That was my first idea for low frequencies: optional FP, but I think
</I>&gt;<i> your optional divisor (or radix in fixed-point math language) solution
</I>&gt;<i> may be a better one.
</I>
It's a tradeoff, but since we already have some pre-selected radix
notation, I think making it an option that the user can provide to
select different radices make sense.  I would tend to agree that just
going with fixed-point (powers of 10) might be the least messy to deal
with, and also makes for easy mental digesting of parameters and
return values for the programmer.
