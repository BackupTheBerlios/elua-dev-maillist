There is already an industry convention for passing floating point
values as integers. It's called fixed point arithmetic, and that is
already in use in eLua: time delays are fixed-point with radix 1000000
(microseconds), duty cycles are fixed point with radix 100.  The
easiest-to-understand interface would be to allow people to specify
the radix of the fixed-point values they are passing, and receive
values back in that same radix they asked for.

In eLua we have three separate usage cases of arbitrary numbers being
passed/returned as integers:
1. high frequencies for clocks, used in PWM clock, timer clock (also
used in ADC), maybe also for I2C and SPI clocks and (even more maybe)
UART baud rates.
2. low frequencies for ADC sampling rates and PWM frequencies
3. duty cycles for PWM

Let's look at these:

The high frequencies already seem precise enough to me for our
purposes, since they're in the 100,000s and 1,000,000, already giving
a precision of 1 part in 100.000 except for baud rates, but I've only
ever seen integer baud rates, and with a minimum of 110. Checking the
actual baud rate that was set and caring about whether it is  less
than 0.5% different is Book 3 stuff, not really a design goal for eLua
if it will make things more complicated.

The resolution of the clock that the low frequencies depend on is
already returned by their setclock() (or setup()) functions, which
return the actual frequency set. This may be very different from the
one requested, often a power-of-two divisor of some fixed system clock
rate, still in the 100,000s or 1,000,000s range.

[[[
As a separate issue, I notice that there is a function in the ADC
module, also called setclock, that does something different from the
other setclock() functions.
i2c, spi and tmr.setclock() all set their own underlying hardware
independently of each other, and they all have a setclock() function
that works the same way as the others (nice!).
adc.setclock() is different: it sets a lower frequency sampling rate
based on a number of cycles of a chosen timer. The user can find the
real frequency of the timer in question, since they can called
tmr.setclock() (or tmr.getclock()) on the timer they are associating
with the adc channel.
I suggest adc.setclock() be renamed to something different, since it's
a different function with different parameters from the other
setclock() functions. In fact, it's more similar in what it does to
the other modules' *.setup() functions.
]]]

In the last case, the duty cycles' true precision is the period of one
cycle of the PWM waveform expressed in PWM clock cycles. That
information is available to the user through pwm.setclock() and
getclock() interfaces.
However, the underlying granularity of the available duty cycles as a
fraction of the PWM wave period changes whenever you change the PWM
frequency.
Users who want to get the maximum precision from their PWM duty cycle
will need to do some interesting math coding to achieve this, but it
should be possible. The Lua code to do that would be good as an
advanced example in the eLua manual. Such power users would need to
figure out the period in clock cycles of the PWM at the actual
frequency that was set, then set the duty cycle with a radix that is
equal to that. That is awkward in the current pwm.setup() function,
since it takes duty cycle and frequency at the same time, so they'd
have to call it twice, once with the wrong duty cycle and once with
the right one once you've found out the actual PWM frequency.

Furthermore, on AVR32, being told to set both the frequency and duty
cycle causes a glitch in the output because the stupid hardware
interface can only set either the frequency or the duty cycle once per
output cycle so you get one cycle either at the new frequency and old
duty cycle or at the old frequency with the new duty cycle.

Worse yet, pwm.setup(id, frequency, duty_cycle) takes two parameters
both of which are in the proposed fixed-point format, which is ugly.
Even in the naive case where you get higher precision by giving a duty
cycle radix of 1000 or 1000000, you'd need to supply a bogus extra
parameter for the undesired precision of the PWM output frequency.

These are three arguments in favour of splitting pwm.setup() into two
functions like pwm.setfreq() and pwm.setduty().  A fourth is that all
the other modules' setup() functions are usually called once at start
of program, then the output is varied as the program runs using
module-specific functions, whereas the current pwm.setup() is used
repeatedly while the programming is running to vary the output.

&gt;<i> 3) The divisor returned is determined by the low-level code in order
</I>&gt;<i> to provide best accuracy in conveying the frequency selected given the
</I>&gt;<i> available variable size for storing the values.
</I>
Trying to select the most precise pair of integers to represent an
arbitrary value is actually quite a difficult math-theoretical
problem, not to mention the difficullty in the user code that would be
necessary to correctly handle them.

&gt;<i> As a potential additional option, 1) could be revised such that if no
</I>&gt;<i> divisor is passed, return divisor is always 1, but if a 1 is passed
</I>&gt;<i> than the divisor is allowed to float as in 3) above.
</I>
We already have the first part, and the defaults are 100 for the duty
cycle, 1,000,000 for delays and 1 for frequencies.  I hink the second
idea is a nightmare for us and for the users.

&gt;<i> provide consistency with current behavior and maximum potential return
</I>&gt;<i> value accuracy.
</I>
I don't value euther of these. On the one hand I'm not afraid to
change the platform (or the Lua) interfaces if that gives a worthwhile
improvement in what you can do or how easy it is to understand, and
the current interface did not consider the practical problems that we
are trying to improve now.
  I seem to remember someone saying that, before we release eLua 1.0,
maintaining backward compatability is not a problem, especially given
the small user base.  Of course, we don't want to break things for no
significant gain.
  I don't think total laboratory-standard mathematical accuracy is as
important a degisn goal for eLua as being simple to use and having an
Lua interface that is pleasant to use and easy to understand.  It's a
design tradeoff, since lab accuracy requires a different set of
interfaces than one that is easy-to-use but adequate for most
purposes.
  Already, moving to optional variable radix fixed point for some
values is a step towards higher accuracy and away from easy-to-use,
but seems to bring some advantages.

&gt;<i> As far as rethinking the API is concerned, I think either way we come
</I>&gt;<i> back to an issue of fractional frequencies with integer expressions
</I>&gt;<i> problem, unless the integer builds are to have different functionality
</I>&gt;<i> than the floating point builds.
</I>
That was my first idea for low frequencies: optional FP, but I think
your optional divisor (or radix in fixed-point math language) solution
may be a better one.
