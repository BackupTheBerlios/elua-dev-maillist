</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on user requirements. Thus, some or all of the timer counters may be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> non-connected.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Then when looking at the register field descriptions for the trigger

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Internal Trigger 1, depending of chip integration
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Internal Trigger 2, depending of chip integration
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is all in doc 32058 dated april 4/2011.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's the one. It also says (in the same chapter)
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The hardware trigger can be one of the TIOA outputs of the Timer
</I>&gt;<i> Counter channels&quot;
</I>
Yeah, I saw that as well.  Then there's also this in &quot;1. Description&quot;

&quot;The PWM modules provides seven independent channels with many
configuration options including polarity, edge alignment and waveform
non overlap control. One PWM channel can trigger ADC conversions for
more accurate close loop control implementations.&quot;

&gt;<i> of which there are three, although the TRGSEL can select one of six
</I>&gt;<i> such inputs, &quot;Internal trigger 0-5&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Mystery.
</I>
Yep, that's how I feel :-)  I'm glad I'm not the only one who is a bit
confused by this.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If there's some documentation somewhere indicating what parts have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this functionality and how its configured, it should be fairly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> straightforward to add hardware triggered ADC support.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've put a query on the avrfreaks forum
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.avrfreaks.net/index.php?name=PNphpBB2&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;p=848231">http://www.avrfreaks.net/index.php?name=PNphpBB2&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;p=848231</A>
</I>
Thanks.  I'll keep an eye on that.  I don't know many people at Atmel,
but I suppose I could also ask someone I've communicated with a few
times around toolchain stuff.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160;If not, we can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use timer interrupts which I've been intending to add support for, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> haven't gotten around to yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That sounds like the best solution, which would work on all platforms,
</I>&gt;<i> including those without hardware trigger support.
</I>
It's also needed at least on older revisions of the STR9 platform,
plus a number of other platforms have restrictions on timer usage for
ADC triggering.  I feel like the best way to do this might be to use
the built-in interrupt support and have C-side handlers.  This way we
could make more of the code platform independent, though it requires
that individual platforms that consume this functionality would have
timer interrupts supported in eLua's interrupt system.

There might be some downsides to using interrupts in terms of latency
or effective clock jitter depending on whether latencies are constant
but it's better than no timer trigger support and should just be
documented when used for a given platform.

I have a few other things pending in my queue but I'm happy to help
with this as time allows.  If there is some way to use periodic
triggers in hardware with the AVR32 chips on the Mizar &amp; EVK1100 I can
put that together or help with it as well once theres some indication
of what supports it and how to do it :-)
