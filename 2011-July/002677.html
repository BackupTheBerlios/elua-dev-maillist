<PRE>Hi,

Thank you Mike; good to hear.

Not at all.
This (below) is not an extensive or final credit list, because my memory is
not good enough to remember in detail. But I count on you all to refine it
and make it ready to be published on the new site soon too:

The new site structure was initially proposed with Mauricio Bomfim and
Vagner Nascimento and later refined with the help from and brainstorming
with Thiago Naves. Marcelo Politzer,  St&#233;phane Beaurin and A&#233;cio Pires..
The RefineryCMS installation (@Heroku) and configuration, as well as the
Ruby scripts for some services (Quotes, News, Paypal integration and
others....) were done by Vagner Nascimento and Mauricio Bomfim.
The main site art was produced by Vagner Nascimento and a professional Web
Designer, sponsored by Raul Nunes (from PUC-Rio but at his own expenses).
The templates to reproduce the main new art for the Tracker (Redmine) and
for the Wiki (MoinMoin) were produced and installed by Aecio Pires.
The templates to reproduce the main art for the Web Builder were done by
Vagner Nascimento and Carlos Eduardo Deodoro.
The refactoring of the doc building Lua scripts were done with Vagner
Nascimento and Guilherme Pacheco.
In all of the steps above, we had a lot of help from James Snyder and Bogdan
Marinescu.

Please forgive me if I forgot someone and (plsssssssss) help me to fix it.

I would like to hear more from the community about migrating ASAP for the
new site. Is it ready enough ?
Of course there are and there will always be refinements to be done. They
are being tracked and processed on the &quot;eLua Services&quot; project, which
currently relates to issues on the main site, wiki, tracker and web builder,
at <A HREF="http://tracker.eluaproject.net/projects/eluaservices/sprints/show">http://tracker.eluaproject.net/projects/eluaservices/sprints/show</A>
You are all welcomed to register and collaborate.

Best
Dado
