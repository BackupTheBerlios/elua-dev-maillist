</I>
Indeed.  My only point here is that so far we've intentionally kept
types that are defined by Lua out of the platform layer so that they
don't depend on Lua itself, and that we also only have integer types.
This doesn't preclude enabling some sort of union or &quot;number&quot; type
from Lua that passes through this layer than can have varying type,
but it changes an existing policy.

There are two ways I can think of that could remain exclusively integer:
1) Passing optional divisors.  For PWM, at one point, I suggested that
we could allow finer resolution duty cyles by allowing other fractions
than per cent such as /1000 (per mil) or 10000 (per basis point).
Clock frequencies could have this as well, either fixed or arbitrary
divisors passed as a parameter.
2) Something similar to POSIX's timer API which allows specification
of a low and higher resolution component.  i.e.: integer Hz + integer
&#181;Hz or nHz.  This came up a while ago, and wasn't for setting clock
frequencies, more for timer intervals, but one could use it for clock
frequencies as well.  So that you would define that you wanted 27 Hz +
270000 &#181;Hz or something similar

Just a few thoughts.  In some ways the gymnastics necessary for the
user, interface implementer, and backend implementer start making the
floating point version sound appealing :-)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Changing it to lua_Number
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One thing we should keep in mind is making sure that such a change
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should work for both integer and floating point versions of eLua.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also, so far we don't pass any lua types or floating point types
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> through the platform interface.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This also brings up the issue of non-integer PWM percentages...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> True, It would be a solution to that too... at least, when compiling
</I>&gt;<i> floating-point Lua.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> On this front, probably fair enough. &#160;When I wrote the platform
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interface I was following the other platform interfaces which used the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> _op function, which is similar to a lot of POSIX functionality.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right. A similar mechanism is used in PWM, TIMER and PIO.
</I>&gt;<i> In the case of PIO, the handling of port/pin selection and processing
</I>&gt;<i> of the variable arguments to specify pins is done in one place for six
</I>&gt;<i> eLua functions . PWM doesn't gain anything from it, and TIMER only
</I>&gt;<i> saves 3 lines of code. But the downside is that it denies the compiler
</I>&gt;<i> some opportunities for code optimization.
</I>
It's certainly making some decisions for the compiler.  I'm not sure
whether in the end it comes out as much of a benefit in terms of code
space or stack usage.  It might be a bit of a wash, but one never
knows :-)  I was persuaded by your noting how how often the 32 bit
passed/returned parameters are used.  You're right that it might give
it a chance to inline things that it otherwise wouldn't which could
save some stack and instructions.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I can try applying this on one or two platforms and see if it works for me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks. Don't apply that patch to trunk though as the documentation
</I>&gt;<i> part was not correct. I think the code is OK except for one wart,
</I>&gt;<i> which is that, as a result of the split, it ends up with two
</I>&gt;<i> functions, one called platform_adc_set_clock() and the other called
</I>&gt;<i> platform_adc_setclock(), which do the same thing (the one just calls
</I>&gt;<i> the other). &#160;setclock() is the platform-specific one implemented in 6
</I>&gt;<i> places, while set_clock is the new C program interface name derived
</I>&gt;<i> from PLATFORM_ADC_OP_SET_CLOCK. As setclock is the only one of the
</I>&gt;<i> platform_adc_*() function where two words are united, I guess we can
</I>&gt;<i> rename platform_adc_setclock() to platform_adc_set_clock() everywhere.
</I>
Noted.
