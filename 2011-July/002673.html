Yep, sorry for complicating things a bit.  As far as the PWM stuff
goes, I was just using that as a reference point.  Discussion of
modifying that should go under another thread (resurrecting an earlier
discussion or tracker issue).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> in order:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - turning the _op primitives into separate functions
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The _op primitives seem to be imitating the ioctl() system call.
</I>&gt;<i> However, the ioctl system call, with hundreds of &quot;operations&quot; and a
</I>&gt;<i> single pointer parameter, was designed to collect hundreds of
</I>&gt;<i> different device-specific functions without having to have hundreds of
</I>&gt;<i> new system calls, and to allow the addition of new operations for new
</I>&gt;<i> hardware devices without having to change the system call interface
</I>&gt;<i> each time. In some Unix platforms the number of system calls is
</I>&gt;<i> limited by the hardware/instruction set, so they were forced to put
</I>&gt;<i> hundreds of different functions through a single hole.
</I>&gt;<i> eLua doesn't have that limitation, since functions are cheap and not
</I>&gt;<i> limited in number. Having one C function per operation also makes the
</I>&gt;<i> documentation clearer, since each operation has its own paragraph
</I>&gt;<i> instead of trying to document 6 different things mixed together.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I assume there's no objection to turning these into separate functions
</I>&gt;<i> where possible.
</I>
Bogdan may or may not object to doing that in other places. I think
the reasons you have laid out, especially for ADC are pretty
compelling.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - allowing more precise low sampling frequencies like Etna's
</I>&gt;<i> seismographs at 27.27Hz, for ADC (and I guess PWM).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree with not making floating point mandatory because one of eLua's
</I>&gt;<i> design objectives is to run on embedded platforms where code size can
</I>&gt;<i> be critical, and the floating point emulator adds 50K to the code
</I>&gt;<i> size.
</I>
At the end of the day, I think this is mainly what needs to remain consistent.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Indeed. &#160;My only point here is that so far we've intentionally kept

I'm not sure what Dado and Bogdan might have to say on the matter, but
given the way it is designed, it is structurally not horribly
complicated to simply jump into a different main function on start and
instead of starting Lua start something else and use the platform API.
 At certain points I've wanted to investigate the work that might be
involved in separating out the lower level API and maybe build system
as a multiplatform hardware abstraction layer that would make it easy
to build C applications or use other VMs on top of the platform
interface (like PyMite/Python-on-a-Chip) for example.  Even if one
isn't interested in Lua per-se the project does provide working
examples of how to build with open toolchains across a variety of
platforms.  I'd like it if we can keep this flexibility.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There are two ways I can think of that could remain exclusively integer:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) Passing optional divisors. &#160;For PWM, at one point, I suggested that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> we could allow finer resolution duty cyles by allowing other fractions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than per cent such as /1000 (per mil) or 10000 (per basis point).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Clock frequencies could have this as well, either fixed or arbitrary
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> divisors passed as a parameter.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I sort of like this idea - using an optional extra parameter in Lua
</I>&gt;<i> which by default would be 100 (for percent) for duty cycles.
</I>&gt;<i> The PWM setup function is currently:
</I>&gt;<i> frequency = pwm.setup(id, frequency, duty_cycle)
</I>&gt;<i> and, as far as duty cycle goes, this is OK, since it is the last
</I>&gt;<i> parameter, but it does nothing for frequencies unless we add two
</I>&gt;<i> optional parameters as divisors with default values of 100 and 1. Or 1
</I>&gt;<i> and 100.
</I>
It would need some adaptation for frequencies, since the values one is
using are generally greater than 1 Hz, so the divisors would likely be
smaller (or arbitrary).  I haven't thought through an implementation
to decide which would be easier.

When you say two optional parameters are you meaning two different
values that could be placed in a divisor parameter, or multiple
additional parameters?  I would be thinking of essentially having two
parameters, the first being the numerator, the latter being the
divisor with a default value of 1 if not passed.  If the user passes a
divisor then the platform will attempt to match the fractional
frequency as closely as hardware allows.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2) Something similar to POSIX's timer API
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> POSIX is not a manual of good interface design. It was born as an
</I>&gt;<i> attempt to unite the different ways that manufacturers had extended
</I>&gt;<i> the original Unix kernel interfaces. All the new stuff since then
</I>&gt;<i> comes from design-by-committee, which usually produces awful
</I>&gt;<i> interfaces. Google POSIX timer API.
</I>
Well, I don't mean to actually _implement_ the posix timer API, merely
borrow the concept of second sized ticks, and mircosecond sized ticks
as a compound value/structure or multiple parameters that could be
passed.

There's some horrible stuff in the POSIX API due to munging of various
implementations together that you mention plus some things were
clearly meant for different purposes in a different time, like POSIX
RS-323 support, but I've come to appreciate it over dealing with some
Win32 API stuff that just feels baroque by comparison.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which allows specification
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of a low and higher resolution component. &#160;i.e.: integer Hz + integer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#181;Hz or nHz. &#160;This came up a while ago, and wasn't for setting clock
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> frequencies, more for timer intervals, but one could use it for clock
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> frequencies as well. &#160;So that you would define that you wanted 27 Hz +
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 270000 &#181;Hz or something similar
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Just a few thoughts. &#160;In some ways the gymnastics necessary for the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> user, interface implementer, and backend implementer start making the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> floating point version sound appealing :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not if floating point becomes necessary, since that goes against the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;embedded&quot; objective of eLua.
</I>
I'm definitely not suggesting tossing integer eLua :-)  While most of
the builds I use may be floating point ones, none of the platforms I'm
using even have hardware FP, and there's a steep cost in code size.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I only suggested that for when FP is already enabled in Lua.
</I>&gt;<i> If it isn't, the user has no way to express a floating point value
</I>&gt;<i> from Lua anyway, or to receive an FP value back.
</I>
Right.  Essentially the function for setting frequency would take a
lua_Number (or something like it) and the code on the backend would be
carefully written to work with both floating point and integer builds.


&gt;<i> What's the lesser of these evils:
</I>&gt;<i> - no way to express low frequencies with precision, limited PWM duty
</I>&gt;<i> cycle resolution (current situation)
</I>&gt;<i> - higher precision in the FP version of Lua, lower precision in the
</I>&gt;<i> integer one, for duty cycles and low frequencies
</I>&gt;<i> - interfaces in Lua and C that express floating point values as some
</I>&gt;<i> combination of integers
</I>
This is the tough question. Generally I would be trying to minimize
pain for implementation and ugliness in the interface I think.  The
divisor/fraction stuff doesn't actually sound too bad to me,
especially if it's done as an optional parameter with a default that's
the same as current behavior.  This way users can blithely ignore the
functionality, and current code continues to work, but even the
integer port can define non-integer frequencies.

It does have one other complication, which is what do we return as the
actual frequency acquired, especially on the integer port.  I suppose
it should be in the form passed, with two returned values, the first
being the numerator and the second being the denominator.  This
wouldn't break existing code, and those who just receive one value
would get just the numerator, plus we can still tell them, with
reasonable accuracy, what frequency they got.

Anyone else have opinions here?
