<PRE>We seem to be talking about four separate questions here:
- turning the _op primitives into separate functions
- allowing more precise low sampling frequencies, like Etna's
seismographs at 27.27Hz, for ADC (and I guess PWM).
- getting higher precision for duty cycles
- use of floating point

in order:

- turning the _op primitives into separate functions

The _op primitives seem to be imitating the ioctl() system call.
However, the ioctl system call, with hundreds of &quot;operations&quot; and a
single pointer parameter, was designed to collect hundreds of
different device-specific functions without having to have hundreds of
new system calls, and to allow the addition of new operations for new
hardware devices without having to change the system call interface
each time. In some Unix platforms the number of system calls is
limited by the hardware/instruction set, so they were forced to put
hundreds of different functions through a single hole.
eLua doesn't have that limitation, since functions are cheap and not
limited in number. Having one C function per operation also makes the
documentation clearer, since each operation has its own paragraph
instead of trying to document 6 different things mixed together.

I assume there's no objection to turning these into separate functions
where possible.

- allowing more precise low sampling frequencies like Etna's
seismographs at 27.27Hz, for ADC (and I guess PWM).

I agree with not making floating point mandatory because one of eLua's
design objectives is to run on embedded platforms where code size can
be critical, and the floating point emulator adds 50K to the code
size.

Is that so that the C platform layer can be more easily re-used, say
as the platform-driver layer for a different language, or in custom
applications?

</I>
I sort of like this idea - using an optional extra parameter in Lua
which by default would be 100 (for percent) for duty cycles.
The PWM setup function is currently:
frequency = pwm.setup(id, frequency, duty_cycle)
and, as far as duty cycle goes, this is OK, since it is the last
parameter, but it does nothing for frequencies unless we add two
optional parameters as divisors with default values of 100 and 1. Or 1
and 100.

&gt;<i> 2) Something similar to POSIX's timer API
</I>
POSIX is not a manual of good interface design. It was born as an
attempt to unite the different ways that manufacturers had extended
the original Unix kernel interfaces. All the new stuff since then
comes from design-by-committee, which usually produces awful
interfaces. Google POSIX timer API.

&gt;<i> which allows specification
</I>&gt;<i> of a low and higher resolution component. &#160;i.e.: integer Hz + integer
</I>&gt;<i> &#181;Hz or nHz. &#160;This came up a while ago, and wasn't for setting clock
</I>&gt;<i> frequencies, more for timer intervals, but one could use it for clock
</I>&gt;<i> frequencies as well. &#160;So that you would define that you wanted 27 Hz +
</I>&gt;<i> 270000 &#181;Hz or something similar
</I>
&gt;<i> Just a few thoughts. &#160;In some ways the gymnastics necessary for the
</I>&gt;<i> user, interface implementer, and backend implementer start making the
</I>&gt;<i> floating point version sound appealing :-)
</I>
Not if floating point becomes necessary, since that goes against the
&quot;embedded&quot; objective of eLua.

I only suggested that for when FP is already enabled in Lua.
If it isn't, the user has no way to express a floating point value
from Lua anyway, or to receive an FP value back.

What's the lesser of these evils:
- no way to express low frequencies with precision, limited PWM duty
cycle resolution (current situation)
- higher precision in the FP version of Lua, lower precision in the
integer one, for duty cycles and low frequencies
- interfaces in Lua and C that express floating point values as some
combination of integers
