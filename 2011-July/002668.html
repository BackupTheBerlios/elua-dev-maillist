Yes, but making sure that when LUA_NUMBER_INTEGRAL, everything is integral.
If Lua is compiled with its usual floating point numbers, the FP
support will be in the executable anyway.
This should make no difference to the Lua interface, it would just
mean that the decimal places in frequencies survive down to where they
need to be used, when they can.

&gt;&gt;<i> Changing it to lua_Number

</I>&gt;<i> One thing we should keep in mind is making sure that such a change
</I>&gt;<i> should work for both integer and floating point versions of eLua.
</I>&gt;<i> Also, so far we don't pass any lua types or floating point types

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This also brings up the issue of non-integer PWM percentages...
</I>
True, It would be a solution to that too... at least, when compiling
floating-point Lua.

&gt;<i> On this front, probably fair enough. &#160;When I wrote the platform
</I>&gt;<i> interface I was following the other platform interfaces which used the
</I>&gt;<i> _op function, which is similar to a lot of POSIX functionality.
</I>
Right. A similar mechanism is used in PWM, TIMER and PIO.
In the case of PIO, the handling of port/pin selection and processing
of the variable arguments to specify pins is done in one place for six
eLua functions . PWM doesn't gain anything from it, and TIMER only
saves 3 lines of code. But the downside is that it denies the compiler
some opportunities for code optimization.

&gt;<i> I can try applying this on one or two platforms and see if it works for me.
</I>
Thanks. Don't apply that patch to trunk though as the documentation
part was not correct. I think the code is OK except for one wart,
which is that, as a result of the split, it ends up with two
functions, one called platform_adc_set_clock() and the other called
platform_adc_setclock(), which do the same thing (the one just calls
the other).  setclock() is the platform-specific one implemented in 6
places, while set_clock is the new C program interface name derived
from PLATFORM_ADC_OP_SET_CLOCK. As setclock is the only one of the
platform_adc_*() function where two words are united, I guess we can
rename platform_adc_setclock() to platform_adc_set_clock() everywhere.
