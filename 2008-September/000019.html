<PRE>Hi,

You'll find my answers below.

Best,
Bogdan

&gt;<i> Just a quick email to ask if you could look over the RAM numbers we're
</I>&gt;<i> getting and see if they are what you'd expect, and whether you had any
</I>&gt;<i> thoughts on other variables/ways to get the RAM footprint down. Also,
</I>&gt;<i> any thoughts on how much executing the script from flash would save (I
</I>&gt;<i> assume it would just be the size of the plain text?).
</I>Yes, it would just be the size of the plain text.

&gt;<i> ---
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Standard lua, w/ elua libs (pio, uart, pd, timer, term, shell, xmodem,
</I>&gt;<i> terminal, romfs):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> eLua# lua -e 'print(collectgarbage(&quot;count&quot;)..&quot;\n&quot;)'
</I>&gt;<i> Press CTRL+Z to exit Lua
</I>&gt;<i> 23.0869140625
</I>Hmmm, 23k only for Lua + platfrom libs. Interesting, I didn't test
this so far. Seems quite large.

&gt;<i> Standard lua, no elua libs (but still with shell)
</I>The shell itself uses very little RAM. The only part of the shell that
uses more RAM (currently 4k) is the &quot;recv&quot; function, but it only
allocates RAM on demand (that is, when &quot;recv&quot; is called) and frees it
before returning from &quot;recv&quot;.

&gt;<i> eLua# lua -e 'print(collectgarbage(&quot;count&quot;)..&quot;\n&quot;)'
</I>&gt;<i> Press CTRL+Z to exit Lua
</I>&gt;<i> 16.80859375
</I>So, all the auxiliary libraries take about 6k of RAM. That's not so
bad, but I think this could be improve (more on this later).

&gt;<i> Standard lua, no elua libs (but still with shell) + romfs
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> eLua# lua -e 'print(collectgarbage(&quot;count&quot;)..&quot;\n&quot;)'
</I>&gt;<i> Press CTRL+Z to exit Lua
</I>&gt;<i> 16.80859375
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (so romfs makes no difference to initial RAM usage)
</I>It shouldn't, as it doesn't use buffers, it reads its data directly
from the flash memory. When the buffered file systems will be in,
things will change, unfortunately. Whatch it though, when you open a
file from Lua, it calls &quot;fopen&quot;, which in turn creates a buffer for
that file when you first access it (via fread/fwrite). This is how the
standard fopen/fread/fwrite... functions work. To overcome this, you
could find the implementation of the io.open function (somewhere in
liolib.c) and add a call to &quot;setbuf( filepointer, NULL )&quot; after the
&quot;fopen&quot; call, thus effectively removing any buffering on that file
(eLua already does this for stdout/stderr, but not for stdin, because
you need the buffer on that one).

&gt;<i> Integer-only lua, w/ elua libs (pio, uart, pd, timer, term, shell,
</I>&gt;<i> xmodem, terminal, romfs):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> eLua# lua -e 'print(collectgarbage(&quot;count&quot;)..&quot;\n&quot;)'
</I>&gt;<i> Press CTRL+Z to exit Lua
</I>&gt;<i> 17
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Integer-only lua, no elua libs (but still with shell)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> eLua# lua -e 'print(collectgarbage(&quot;count&quot;)..&quot;\n&quot;)'
</I>&gt;<i> Press CTRL+Z to exit Lua
</I>&gt;<i> 12
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>So the difference between &quot;bare bones&quot; eLua (no libs, just the shell)
in floating point mode and integer only mode is about 4k of memory.
Now THIS is interesting, we need to figure out where this comes from
and work on this.
Now, finally, some ideas to improve RAM usage:

- the constants in some of our modules (like PIO.Px_y, term.KC_xxxx)
are now written explicitely, and thus consume RAM memory. We could use
methamethods (index) instead to &quot;resolve&quot; these constants. This will
of course add to the execution time, but I think it's a perfectly good
compromise.

- remove some of the modules that Lua preloads. The newly released
0.4.1 already removes the &quot;os&quot; and &quot;package&quot; modules, as they're not
used anyway, and makes &quot;math&quot; configurable just like the platform
modules.

- implement &quot;emergency garbage collection&quot;
(<A HREF="http://lua-users.org/wiki/EmergencyGarbageCollector">http://lua-users.org/wiki/EmergencyGarbageCollector</A>). I did some
tests with this, and it has a very strong impact on the memory
consumption (see
<A HREF="http://lua-users.org/lists/lua-l/2008-05/threads.html#00023">http://lua-users.org/lists/lua-l/2008-05/threads.html#00023</A> for more
details). Unfortunately, it has a very strong impact on the execution
speed two (at least on its most aggressive working mode) but this
compromise is something one must live with in programming. This is a
&quot;must have&quot; for eLua 0.5.

- use a memory allocator with a smaller overhead. dlmalloc/TLSF/other
seggregated allocators use some sort of &quot;page tables&quot; (TLSF has even a
two-level page table) that consumes memory (on TLSF the overhead is as
large as 3k!). I have a very simple, very fragmentable, yet very low
overhead chained allocator that I wrote myself, and I intend to
include it in a future version (maybe 0.5, but I'm not sure at this
point). Then again, in my tests, this allocator didn't perform all
that well, but this is VERY dependent on the application.

- figure out what I mentioned earlier: why the difference between
&quot;bare bones&quot; Lua in floating point mode and integer only mode is that
large. Obviously it can't be because of the math library, I can't
imagine a math library with such a huge RAM consumption (and I should
know, I worked on two different math emulation libraries in my past).
Could it be just because we don't register the &quot;math&quot; module anymore?
It still seems that 4k is a LOT of memory gained from just removing
the &quot;math&quot; module. I don't know how to test this, unfortunately.

Thanks a lot for this e-mail, I was working on some memory statistics
myself, but never for a minute thought about running
collectgarbage(&quot;count&quot;), as I completely forgot that collectgarbage
can also return the ammount of memory used by Lua :)
And, as a personal preference, could we continue this discussion on
the elua-dev list?

Best,
Bogdan
