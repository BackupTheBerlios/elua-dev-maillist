<PRE>Hi everyone

I think it's time to inform you about our Project because i think i'll need
your help in next few months. I'm studying electrical engineering in
Switzerland and we decided to realize our final project with eLua, because
i've seen how smart and strong it is :)

What the Project is about:
The goal is to develop prototype for a home automation system, which can be
controlled with an android-device. So a universal box with digital and
analog I/O's can be remote-controlled via wlan by the android-device.
Generally there will be two main functions:
1. normal remote mode, where the Outputs directly can be controlled.
2. The user can click together State-Machine and send the written program to
the universal-box. The box can do this program autonomous without a
connection to the android-device.

How i think to realize:
We tested the basic things with eLua with the EK-LM3S8962. For the
communication we used a wlan modul (from Roving Networks) which can be
controlled very easy over UART. So we and are generally able to control the
I/O ports from the android device at the moment.
The harder part is the thing with the autonomous program. The android-device
will create eLua-Script which will be stored on the SD-Card. So that it can
be loaded an executed if demanded.

A question for the beginning:
The main topic at the moment is the microcontroller. I thought, i'll use the
LM3S6965 because of the status list (important are mmc, adc, pwm..). But the
LM3S9B92 has more RAM (96kB instead of 64kB) which i think could be useful
for the autonom program..? Disadvantages of LM3S9B92: ADC and SPI needs more
testing (??) / SD card not on eval-board.

So, do you have any advices for me? LM3S6965, LM3S9B92 ore another one?

Furthermore there are some parts, where i'm interested to expand some things
of eLua (i hope i have enough C-skills :S):
-&gt; it would be very nice, if the os-library from lua could be implemented.
It would be helpful if i could use os.remove() for the SD-card, os.time()
and os.date() for RTC-functions (my wlan-modul can get the UNIX-timestamp
from a timeserver). Is there done work with the os-library? I've seen you
discussed it last year:

os-lib 

So thats all i think :) I am very grateful for help!

Kind regards,
Stefan

Ah, here is a website of the Project
(very small, and not much information...just for the teachers :P)
