</I>
To be honest I'm not certain that would be possible, depending on what
you mean.  Though I've helped to convert the module to a
platform-specific module that someone else provided I haven't looked
into the implementation details of this particular platform.

The phase A &amp; B channels are both needed for a given implementation so
that one can disambiguate between rotation in one direction vs
another.  Otherwise it would be behaving just like a counter. The
velocity should just be a derivative of what the counter that's
integrating both channels has been doing during the last number of
clock cycles (or some filtered version of that).

One can do quadrature decoding in software, or one can also use
separate chips that will convert phase A/B into channels that might be
a bit easier to to work with with just a counter or interrupts like
this one: <A HREF="http://www.lsicsi.com/pdfs/Data_Sheets/LS7183_LS7184.pdf">http://www.lsicsi.com/pdfs/Data_Sheets/LS7183_LS7184.pdf</A>

Depending on the needs of the project, it might be possible to
multiplex multiple encoders onto a single QEI, but depending on the
maximum frequency of the quadrature phase info, it's entirely possible
to lose counts.  If for the application you might be confident that
you can do the switching fast enough not to drop counts it might be
possible, but I haven't looked at the qei peripheral in enough detail.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, I am wondering why the ability to use a timer input capture pin as an
</I>&gt;<i> edge timer and generate an interrupt does not seem to be supported in the
</I>&gt;<i> timer documentation. &#160;In this way, I think the general purpose timers could
</I>&gt;<i> also be used for velocity measurement.
</I>
I think the edge count mode should do what you want?  We don't have
that functionality implemented for eLua, but I think it should
probably be straightforward from the docs?

The platform also certainly supports triggering interrupts on
different edges for GPIO, where you could implement quadrature
decoding in an interrupt handler (with the assumption that the
interrupt can run fast enough to capture all events... this might at
least give you an indication of cases where events are missed if an
interrupt fires while you're still in one that's running).


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. &#160;From other posts, it looks as though you are familiar with eluarpc as
</I>&gt;<i> well. &#160;I noticed that you guys are working on rpc over ip. &#160;For my purposes,
</I>&gt;<i> I want to implement rpc over SPI or I2C or both. &#160;Anything in the works for
</I>&gt;<i> that?
</I>
Either of these should be possible.  SPI might be pretty
straightforward from the existing implementation, since SPI should
mirror way we use a UART on a lot of levels:
luarpc_elua_uart.c

I2C would require working a bit more around that protocol, but
shouldn't be too painful.  If you need help here I can try and provide
some guidance though I haven't put in the time to try and implement
this.
