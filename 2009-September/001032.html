<PRE>Hello All,
   Tony, I did attend the last 3 MCU Days in Brazil (it was called MSP430
day until last year) and in the last two, I brought some students (3~4) with
me too.
   The first one was in Curitiba, PR, where I also presented my contribution
to Fabio Pereira's book on
MSP430&lt;<A HREF="http://www.editoraerica.com.br/buscafinal.asp?cod=0670">http://www.editoraerica.com.br/buscafinal.asp?cod=0670</A>&gt;,
C code examples and small libs.
   The second one was in S&#227;o Jos&#233; dos Campos, SP (or was it in Rio ? :),
where me and Fabio also showed his book on
ARM&lt;<A HREF="http://compare.buscape.com.br/tecnologia-arm-microcontroladores-de-32-bits-fabio-pereira-8536501707.html">http://compare.buscape.com.br/tecnologia-arm-microcontroladores-de-32-bits-fabio-pereira-8536501707.html</A>&gt;and
hisfirst book in english, on
HCS08&lt;<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/HCS08-Unleashed-Designers-Guide-Microcontrollers/dp/1419685929">http://www.amazon.com/HCS08-Unleashed-Designers-Guide-Microcontrollers/dp/1419685929</A>&gt;,
both of which I was glad to work on the revisions and some code too.
   The third one was in S&#227;o Paulo, SP, not exactly &quot;close&quot; to Rio (~400 Km)
but we were there, in a team of 5 from my Lab.
   Texas always had (at least before the world crisis :) nice toys and
souvenirs to offer but my general impressions of the events that I've been,
is that it they are too much focused on marketing and commercial aspects and
not on everybody's clear expectations; technical presentations and real-word
application examples.
   The (technical) questions from the audience were hardly answered :( and
there was no time to get together with other developpers in the event's
space :(
   It may be different in other countries I suppose and it seems to getting
better here too.
   Now that other MCUs will be part of the show (and Luminary Micro's too !
:<i>), I would love to bring some kits running nice eLua applications and games
</I>to show how they rock. At least 5 of my students will attend the MCU Day in
Rio this year but, unfortunately, I'll be down in south of Brazil at those
days, presenting eLua in an University in Ibirama, SC (21st oct) and another
one in Joinville, SC (23rd oct).
   Tks for bringing this to the list and I hope those who can attend, don't
forget to bring your LM kits running eLua apps rocking on them ! :)

Best
Dado
