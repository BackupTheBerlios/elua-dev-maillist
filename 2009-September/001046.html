Yes, this is pretty much the point. Plus, with LuaRPC, you can do a lot of
interesting stuff on small devices too :) You probably can't reduce the code
size significantly without reducing the functionality quite a bit too, but
then again, most of the time you'd be fine with reduced functionality in the
real world. One of the ideas I had is to define a (small) number of
different &quot;profiles&quot;, or, in other words, different levels of conformance
with &quot;regular&quot; Lua. Then, obviously, a smaller device would implement a
simpler profile, and more feature-rich devices would naturally go towards a
more complex profile.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I don't know anything about the Python VM, but I can see a Lua VM running in
8k (quite limited though) or maybe even 4k (severely limited :) ). Given
that the code density on a 8-bit CPU is generally better than what you can
find on an ARM, we can expect surprises in this area.
One of the things that I really want to do is to let the VM execute code
from arbitrary memories (for example SPI/I2C EEPROMs) and use different
types of RAMs (for example SPI/I2C SRAMs :) ). Or simply use a serial FRAM
that can work both as a SRAM and an EEPROM. These are small, relatively
inexpensive devices, and having a VM that can take advantage of them can
greatly expand the MCU capabilities.

Best,
Bogdan

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; their memory sizes tend to top out too low.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For me, the real breakpoint comes when you can sell chips with the

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; already loaded. If you could just plug one of these into any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; computer and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have it present as an MSD flash drive you could simply copy Lua

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it and even edit them in place (and you get cross-platform
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; capability for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; free). If we could lose the need to bootstrap the chips from source

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; help, but ideally this is a Lua system so users should not have to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mess
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; about with C at all!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Still seems to me we are either waiting for chips with more memory or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; seriously going the cross-development route, stripping back on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; chip to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bytecode runtime only and parsing on the host computer. But even
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there, lack
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of RAM is likely to be a constraint. (As we have discussed before,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; no point going multi-chip because if you go that route you may as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; well put
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Linux and standard Lua on it.)
