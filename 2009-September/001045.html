<PRE>John, the goal isn't to go 8-bit just for the sake of 8-bits.  It's to  
reduce the memory requirements of the VM so it can run on  
architectures with less RAM (such as 8-bit devices).  I have made a  
reduced Python VM (www.pythononachip.org) and was able to get it to  
run in 4 KB with features equivalent to a BASIC language.  I've added  
features expected in a Python VM (like classes and threads) and now  
the minimum footprint is 8 KB.  Considering the footprint of the  
standard desktop Python can be reduced by this much, I believe a  
language such as Lua--designed to be petite from the very beginning-- 
stands a good chance of being reduced to a 4-8 KB footprint as well.
