&gt;<i>  I bow to your superior experience (and intellect!)

</I>I suspect you're overestimating me :)

&gt;<i> because I do not even really understand what we mean by &#8220;8-bit&#8221; or &#8220;16-bit&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> anymore.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>It's more a problem of symbols for me. Saying that something &quot;works on
8-bit&quot; is largely equivalent in my mind to saying &quot;we have this piece of
software that requires so little memory that it can run even on 8-bit
micros&quot;. Other that that, you're definitely right; with an ANSI C compiler,
you can compile standard Lua on any 8-bit architecture with sufficient
resources.

&gt;<i> I suppose in Lua it is the size of the Number type, but Microchip&#8217;s &#8220;8-Bit&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> devices actually have 16-bit instruction words and 20-bit memory addressing!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yes, but:

- very few of them have an external memory interface.
- if they do, you still can't run code from an external memory, thus the
limitation becomes program memory space instead of data memory space (it's
kinda hard to fit Lua in the limited memory space of most 8-bit MCUs)
- they have a Harvard architecture, so you'll have lots of problems with
&quot;const&quot;. Which sometimes means that the &quot;const&quot; data ends up in RAM, which
is a huge penalty.

&gt;<i> Most ARM devices also have the 16-Bit instruction set even though they are
</I>&gt;<i> called &#8220;32-Bit&#8221;. As far as I know, most code density comparisons give tens
</I>&gt;<i> of percent differences not hundreds or thousands. Also why would it save RAM
</I>&gt;<i> &#8211; my understanding of the large RAM requirement of Lua (relatively speaking)
</I>&gt;<i> comes from its reliance on tables?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Exactly. This is why I was saying that a complete rewrite with the VM is
needed to make Lua less RAM and Flash hungry. That's not to say that I have
a good idea on how to replace tables at the moment :), even with accepting
reduced functionality, but I'm working on this. And this isn't by far the
only thing an 8-bit oriented VM must be aware of.

&gt;<i> I suppose if your Boolean data type is 8-bits rather than 16 it does save
</I>&gt;<i> some wastage though!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Having different storage for different data types is definitely a good idea,
but from my observations this is quite hard to do with the Lua VM (including
the bytecode, which dosesn't make provisions for different data sizes) .
Still, something to think about :)

Best,
Bogdan

</I>&gt;<i> John, the goal isn't to go 8-bit just for the sake of 8-bits.  It's to
</I>&gt;<i> reduce the memory requirements of the VM so it can run on
</I>&gt;<i> architectures with less RAM (such as 8-bit devices).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, this is pretty much the point. Plus, with LuaRPC, you can do a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> interesting stuff on small devices too :) You probably can't reduce the code
</I>&gt;<i> size significantly without reducing the functionality quite a bit too, but
</I>&gt;<i> then again, most of the time you'd be fine with reduced functionality in the
</I>&gt;<i> real world. One of the ideas I had is to define a (small) number of
</I>&gt;<i> different &quot;profiles&quot;, or, in other words, different levels of conformance
</I>&gt;<i> with &quot;regular&quot; Lua. Then, obviously, a smaller device would implement a
</I>&gt;<i> simpler profile, and more feature-rich devices would naturally go towards a
</I>&gt;<i> more complex profile.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have made a
</I>&gt;<i> reduced Python VM (www.pythononachip.org) and was able to get it to
</I>&gt;<i> run in 4 KB with features equivalent to a BASIC language.  I've added
</I>&gt;<i> features expected in a Python VM (like classes and threads) and now
</I>&gt;<i> the minimum footprint is 8 KB.  Considering the footprint of the
</I>&gt;<i> standard desktop Python can be reduced by this much, I believe a
</I>&gt;<i> language such as Lua--designed to be petite from the very beginning--
</I>&gt;<i> stands a good chance of being reduced to a 4-8 KB footprint as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know anything about the Python VM, but I can see a Lua VM running
</I>&gt;<i> in 8k (quite limited though) or maybe even 4k (severely limited :) ). Given
</I>&gt;<i> that the code density on a 8-bit CPU is generally better than what you can
</I>&gt;<i> find on an ARM, we can expect surprises in this area.
</I>&gt;<i> One of the things that I really want to do is to let the VM execute code
</I>&gt;<i> from arbitrary memories (for example SPI/I2C EEPROMs) and use different
</I>&gt;<i> types of RAMs (for example SPI/I2C SRAMs :) ). Or simply use a serial FRAM
</I>&gt;<i> that can work both as a SRAM and an EEPROM. These are small, relatively
</I>&gt;<i> inexpensive devices, and having a VM that can take advantage of them can
</I>&gt;<i> greatly expand the MCU capabilities.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What would be the objective of going 8 bit? As I see it, the

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the moment is the memory footprint and if anything 8-bit would make
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; harder because there is generally fewer 8-bit chips with large
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; memory (and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; large memory 8-bit devices are likely to be just as expensive as 16
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or 32
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bit ones). On the other hand a port to Microchip's 16 bit devices
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; nice - they are about the only manufacturer still selling modern low

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; count devices in PDIP packages. Trouble is they are not ARM at 32-
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bit and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; their memory sizes tend to top out too low.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For me, the real breakpoint comes when you can sell chips with the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; firmware
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; already loaded. If you could just plug one of these into any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; computer and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have it present as an MSD flash drive you could simply copy Lua
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; scripts onto
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it and even edit them in place (and you get cross-platform
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; capability for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; free). If we could lose the need to bootstrap the chips from source
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; code,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there would be a much larger market for them! Pre-cooked toolchains
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; help, but ideally this is a Lua system so users should not have to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mess
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; about with C at all!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Still seems to me we are either waiting for chips with more memory or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; seriously going the cross-development route, stripping back on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; chip to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bytecode runtime only and parsing on the host computer. But even
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there, lack
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of RAM is likely to be a constraint. (As we have discussed before,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; no point going multi-chip because if you go that route you may as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; well put
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Linux and standard Lua on it.)
