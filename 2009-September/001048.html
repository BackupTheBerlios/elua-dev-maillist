<PRE>I bow to your superior experience (and intellect!) because I do not even
really understand what we mean by &quot;8-bit&quot; or &quot;16-bit&quot; anymore. I suppose in
Lua it is the size of the Number type, but Microchip's &quot;8-Bit&quot; devices
actually have 16-bit instruction words and 20-bit memory addressing! Most
ARM devices also have the 16-Bit instruction set even though they are called
&quot;32-Bit&quot;. As far as I know, most code density comparisons give tens of
percent differences not hundreds or thousands. Also why would it save RAM -
my understanding of the large RAM requirement of Lua (relatively speaking)
comes from its reliance on tables? I suppose if your Boolean data type is
8-bits rather than 16 it does save some wastage though!

John, the goal isn't to go 8-bit just for the sake of 8-bits.  It's to
reduce the memory requirements of the VM so it can run on
architectures with less RAM (such as 8-bit devices).  


Yes, this is pretty much the point. Plus, with LuaRPC, you can do a lot of
interesting stuff on small devices too :) You probably can't reduce the code
size significantly without reducing the functionality quite a bit too, but
then again, most of the time you'd be fine with reduced functionality in the
real world. One of the ideas I had is to define a (small) number of
different &quot;profiles&quot;, or, in other words, different levels of conformance
with &quot;regular&quot; Lua. Then, obviously, a smaller device would implement a
simpler profile, and more feature-rich devices would naturally go towards a
more complex profile.
 

I have made a
reduced Python VM (www.pythononachip.org) and was able to get it to
run in 4 KB with features equivalent to a BASIC language.  I've added
features expected in a Python VM (like classes and threads) and now
the minimum footprint is 8 KB.  Considering the footprint of the
standard desktop Python can be reduced by this much, I believe a
language such as Lua--designed to be petite from the very beginning--
stands a good chance of being reduced to a 4-8 KB footprint as well.


I don't know anything about the Python VM, but I can see a Lua VM running in
8k (quite limited though) or maybe even 4k (severely limited :) ). Given
that the code density on a 8-bit CPU is generally better than what you can
find on an ARM, we can expect surprises in this area.
One of the things that I really want to do is to let the VM execute code
from arbitrary memories (for example SPI/I2C EEPROMs) and use different
types of RAMs (for example SPI/I2C SRAMs :) ). Or simply use a serial FRAM
that can work both as a SRAM and an EEPROM. These are small, relatively
inexpensive devices, and having a VM that can take advantage of them can
greatly expand the MCU capabilities.

Best,
Bogdan
