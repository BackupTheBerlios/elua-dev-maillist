<PRE>What would be the objective of going 8 bit? As I see it, the roadblock at
the moment is the memory footprint and if anything 8-bit would make that
harder because there is generally fewer 8-bit chips with large memory (and
large memory 8-bit devices are likely to be just as expensive as 16 or 32
bit ones). On the other hand a port to Microchip's 16 bit devices would be
nice - they are about the only manufacturer still selling modern low pin
count devices in PDIP packages. Trouble is they are not ARM at 32-bit and
their memory sizes tend to top out too low.

For me, the real breakpoint comes when you can sell chips with the firmware
already loaded. If you could just plug one of these into any computer and
have it present as an MSD flash drive you could simply copy Lua scripts onto
it and even edit them in place (and you get cross-platform capability for
free). If we could lose the need to bootstrap the chips from source code,
there would be a much larger market for them! Pre-cooked toolchains would
help, but ideally this is a Lua system so users should not have to mess
about with C at all!

Still seems to me we are either waiting for chips with more memory or
seriously going the cross-development route, stripping back on the chip to
bytecode runtime only and parsing on the host computer. But even there, lack
of RAM is likely to be a constraint. (As we have discussed before, there is
no point going multi-chip because if you go that route you may as well put
Linux and standard Lua on it.)
