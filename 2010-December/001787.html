</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/elua-dev">bounces at lists.berlios.de</A>] On Behalf Of James Snyder

</I>&gt;<i> I think we can get away with not using real stack-needing threads for
</I>&gt;<i> things like this.  I'm jumping back in to this conversation more than
</I>&gt;<i> a few steps later than when I last chimed in, but I think there might
</I>&gt;<i> be a way to meld these two concepts together.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> With eLua ISRs there isn't an explicit scheduler, just a queue that
</I>&gt;<i> gets examined every two VM instructions.  This provides a coarse
</I>&gt;<i> grained pre-emptive model for handling ISRs. This could be adapted to
</I>&gt;<i> provide some of the functionality that John is describing by allowing
</I>&gt;<i> for different types of events to trigger Lua ISR calls.  There is also
</I>&gt;<i> the difference that John/Rupin's version makes use of coroutines
</I>&gt;<i> instead of functions to allow for a given &quot;thread&quot; of execution to
</I>&gt;<i> have points where it yields control, but expects to be resumed at a
</I>&gt;<i> later time.  This has an advantage over pure function handlers in that
</I>&gt;<i> when yielding the coroutine has its scope saved, which will come back
</I>&gt;<i> when it gets resumed.  I presume you could get some of this by using
</I>&gt;<i> closures with the current model, but there is something to be said for
</I>&gt;<i> mixing these concepts together together so that if one knows a given
</I>&gt;<i> thread won't be able to do something until new data comes in, it would
</I>&gt;<i> be wasteful to have it sit in a loop polling for something and have
</I>&gt;<i> that be pre-empted in order for anything else to happen, when instead
</I>&gt;<i> you could have the ISR facility allow a coroutine to &quot;yield&quot; or
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;select&quot; by asking the ISR facility to resume it when a given event
</I>&gt;<i> comes in.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Unless I've completely glossed over things, this would seem to provide
</I>&gt;<i> the benefits of pre-emptive ISRs and select-like behavior under a
</I>&gt;<i> single model?  Of course the Lua ISR system would need to be adapted
</I>&gt;<i> to not only handle functions, but do the right thing with coroutines.
</I>
I think you are right - plus I just realised that this mechanism could be
used to force a coroutine to yield asynchronously so we could use it for
full pre-emptive multitasking within a single Lua State! (Albeit as you say
&quot;course grained&quot;.) Given that the Lua VM allows you to take this kind of
liberty using debug hooks, it ought to be feasible to patch it to do this
in-line without the performance overhead.

I will do some experimenting with this on my Visual Studio compiled Windows
runtime.
