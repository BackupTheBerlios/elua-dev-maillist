&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 3.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Multi-threading support. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'll have to look at this example again. IIRC his example is designed

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Without having re-read the article, the idea here would be that
</I>&gt;<i> instead of writing one's own coroutine scheduler in Lua, you would
</I>&gt;<i> have a dedicated scheduler, written in C that is provided by the

</I>
If we are satisfied with coroutine (cooperative) multitasking, I do not
think any additional threading support would be needed. The thread type
which supports coroutines in standard Lua should be all we need, along with
interrupt handlers (IH) written in C. The IH would set event flags and the
scheduler would use these flags to determine which coroutines are candidates
to be resumed. Rapin's basic idea is to enhance the yield method so it
specifies resume criteria (on serial reception, after 100ms, when a pin
changes state etc.). The scheduler (which as you suggest could be
generalised and written in C) starts all coroutines, so coroutines always
yield back to it. The scheduler could also be able to run Lua functions on
the primary thread, so combining coroutine scheduling with a simple event
handling paradigm (for example to hook up an LED to follow changing states
on an input pin). So the event abstraction comprises a boolean flag and a
list of functions and threads (coroutines). The flag can (optionally) be
connected to a specified &quot;interrupt port&quot; in the runtime. When the flag
becomes set (explicitly from Lua or by an IH), the scheduler executes the
functions and resumes the coroutines sequentially.
Very ambitiously, this scheme could perhaps even be extended to do hard
real-time. All the code segments would be profiled for minimum and maximum
execution time and the scheduler would use real-time critical path analysis
to guarantee specified event response time requirements (or raise an
exception if impossible). For this, the scheduler would have to take over
managing the garbage collector as well.
