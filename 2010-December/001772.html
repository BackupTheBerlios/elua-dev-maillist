<PRE>The things I need in the eLua mbed implementation for my own projects are as
follows:

 

1.       Ethernet support (not in James's mbed 'preliminary' port at the
moment).

2.       Support for USB MSD (flash drives and hard disks). There does not
seem to be any USB work in eLua to date, so this is maybe breaking
completely new ground. However it looks relatively straightforward to slot
this in under the current FAT filesystem support for SD/MMC. Later I will
need serial over USB and MSD device emulation as I want to replace the
auxiliary JTAG chip on the mbed with an on-chip implementation.

3.       Multi-threading support. Initially I thought of trying to put
FreeRTOS or similar in under eLua, but on reflection that is likely to be
too profligate with RAM as the Lua RAM overhead will then be per-thread.
Then I read Patrick Rapin's &quot;Enhanced Coroutines in Lua&quot; chapter in &quot;Lua
Programming Gems&quot;. Basically this suggests a coroutine scheduler with an
enhanced yield method which yields back to the scheduler until some event
occurs. For example you could yield for 100ms and the scheduler could resume
some other coroutine or run other functions in the main thread during this
time. This seems an ideal approach for microcontrollers as it allows a
non-blocking wait for interrupt and cooperative multi-threading.

4.       LIN networking support - this should be relatively easy to build on
top of the current serial port support, perhaps could even be done in Lua.

 

Is anyone already working on any of the above? I'm guessing at least 1 is
already in train - is it likely to deliver within the next quarter? I will
be happy to contribute anything I have to do myself back to the project or
to help anyone already working on something.
