</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; our objective is to let them write
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; programs in Lua on an SD card in autorun.lua, put it in the board and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; have it work,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yep. It works already for autorun.lc (Lua compiled bytecodes) too.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; thereby reducing the technical overhead,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Right.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But still mentioning the web-based dev, the future eLua Web Builder
</I>&gt;<i> versions
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will likely offer a simple text editor to allow users to type directly
</I>&gt;<i> their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; programs into the web service.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's nice, but I don't think it would work well in practice. I mean
</I>&gt;<i> OK, you type them, but what about testing?
</I>

Well, it is just a front-end enhancement for when we have a web-based
simulator, which can be actual boards connected to the service for remote
experimenting. But it is just an idea for now.



&gt;<i> The idea (well, MY idea :)
</I>&gt;<i> ) behind eLua is to have a develop-run-test development cycle: write a
</I>&gt;<i> small part of your program, test it on the spot, fix errors, continue.
</I>&gt;<i> I don't personally see a real advantage in writing your programs
</I>&gt;<i> inside the Web Builder as opposed to using a simple text editor. Sure,
</I>&gt;<i> you skip the manual cross-compiling step, but you still can't test it
</I>&gt;<i> properly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Sure. It is just that some users seem to be hightly web-biased and we're
trying to please them too :)



&gt;<i> Which reminds me. I'm currently working on a standalone computer based
</I>&gt;<i> on eLua, with video output, PS/2 keyboard support and (hopefully) a
</I>&gt;<i> lot of other nice features. It's in early stages of development, but
</I>&gt;<i> the main features are already planned. One of them is an integrated
</I>&gt;<i> text editor, so the user will actually be able to use the
</I>&gt;<i> forementioned develop-run-test cycle properly directory from his eLua
</I>&gt;<i> board. This will not run properly on small boards, as it will require
</I>&gt;<i> a lot of RAM, but it's very well suited towards system with external
</I>&gt;<i> RAM such as the STM3210E-EVAL (which is what I'm currently using),
</I>&gt;<i> ATEVK1100 and of course Mizar32 :) So I'm going to try to make this
</I>&gt;<i> editor as generic as possible. Don't hold your breath though, it will
</I>&gt;<i> be a long while until it's ready.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Very cool (and I wish you win some contests with it too :).
Of course we'll hear some complains about the editor, as each developer has
one of his choice and hates to death all the others :) But hey, we still try
to please everyone :)


.............

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; It's like a return to the late 1970s. You remember?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I certainly do :) but Bogdan had not been link edited yet :) :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> :) That's a nice way to put it. You're right; my earliest memories are
</I>&gt;<i> from the late 80s, when my father managed to build me a HC-85 (a local
</I>&gt;<i> clone of the ZX Spectrum) after quite a bit of struggle. I was in the
</I>&gt;<i> second grade back then, and man, I had loads of fun with that machine,
</I>&gt;<i> and I learnt a lot. I guess I'm somehow trying to replicate that
</I>&gt;<i> process with my eLua computer project. I really believe it would make
</I>&gt;<i> a wonderful educational platform and an equally nice automation
</I>&gt;<i> platform.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It will.
Can't wait to see the specs to see if we can add some hardware in a modular
way.
But I'm afraid we'll have to wait until it's revealed by some contest
results :)
..........

Best,
