</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Ethernet support (not in James&#8217;s mbed &#8216;preliminary&#8217; port at the

</I>
It could be made to work with the existing uIP module, but I think
what we'd like to do is either switch to lwIP or some combination of a
UDP stack and fuller TCP/IP stack such that in cases where minimal
resources are available the user could just use the UDP stack.

I personally haven't been using ethernet much on eLua so I'm not sure
if/when I'd get to adding the current ethernet module to mbed or if
I'd get around to the more extensive task of working on inserting a
replacement stack.

I'd definitely be willing to at least provide help to anyone who is
interested in improving this area and has less familiarity with eLua
and it's internals.

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Support for USB MSD (flash drives and hard disks). There does not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> seem to be any USB work in eLua to date, so this is maybe breaking
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> completely new ground. However it looks relatively straightforward to slot
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this in under the current FAT filesystem support for SD/MMC. Later I will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> need serial over USB and MSD device emulation as I want to replace the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> auxiliary JTAG chip on the mbed with an on-chip implementation.
</I>
I don't think this is will be too hard.  At least for Luminary devices
that provide hardware support for this, there's an example
(usb_host_msc in the StellarisWare distribution) of how to set this up
with FatFs (which we use).  I've thought about playing with this a bit
on the 9B92 that I have, but haven't gotten around to it.  For LPC1768
(what's in the mbed) there's also an example for this (called USBMem
in the lcp17xx cmsis driver lib).

I'd also like to try enabling a CDC (for LM3S there's also a code
example for this), but I haven't gotten around to it because most of
the luminary boards come with an integrated JTAG + UART device.

Adding support on a single platform for any of these would probably be
pretty easy.  Where we might have to put in more thought on would be
what we might want to make generic and part of the eLua core of any of
this and what shape that might take.

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Multi-threading support. Initially I thought of trying to put
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> FreeRTOS or similar in under eLua, but on reflection that is likely to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> too profligate with RAM as the Lua RAM overhead will then be per-thread.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I beleive you're right.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Then I read Patrick Rapin&#8217;s &#8220;Enhanced Coroutines in Lua&#8221; chapter in &#8220;Lua
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Programming Gems&#8221;. Basically this suggests a coroutine scheduler with an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> enhanced yield method which yields back to the scheduler until some event
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> occurs. For example you could yield for 100ms and the scheduler could resume
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some other coroutine or run other functions in the main thread during this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> time. This seems an ideal approach for microcontrollers as it allows a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> non-blocking wait for interrupt and cooperative multi-threading.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Man, I really have to get me that book :) However, I believe that an
</I>&gt;<i> event-based system would work on the current system too, without the
</I>&gt;<i> need to yield every 100ms. Just wait on the coroutine until some event
</I>&gt;<i> occurs, and if it happens to be the 100ms timeout event yield back to
</I>&gt;<i> the calling thread.
</I>
I'll have to look at this example again. IIRC his example is designed
to work with pthreads and windows threads, but I suspect it wouldn't
be hard to adapt to another, simpler threading API.

Without having re-read the article, the idea here would be that
instead of writing one's own coroutine scheduler in Lua, you would
have a dedicated scheduler, written in C that is provided by the
system.  I suspect that it wouldn't be too complicated for us to do
something like this, especially if the scheduler is quite
simple/stupid like the PIL example: <A HREF="http://www.lua.org/pil/9.4.html">http://www.lua.org/pil/9.4.html</A>

FYI, the lpg sources for this article are here:

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; LIN networking support &#8211; this should be relatively easy to build on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> top of the current serial port support, perhaps could even be done in Lua.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You're probably right about this.
</I>
Ditto.  I'm not very familiar with this besides quickly looking it up
on Wikipedia :-)  If it doesn't require anything more in terms of UART
configuration than what we already provide, you could probably do it
all in Lua and not even have to touch any C.  Depending on the
application it may make more sense to use the platform abstraction API
from the C side and have that handle receiving and decoding packets.
We've already implemented some protocols on top of serial with decent
success in the form of LuaRPC and RFS, both of which use the platform
API from C.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is anyone already working on any of the above? I&#8217;m guessing at least 1 is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> already in train &#8211; is it likely to deliver within the next quarter? I will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be happy to contribute anything I have to do myself back to the project or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to help anyone already working on something.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry, I have less and less free time to work on eLua, so I can't
</I>&gt;<i> really help here :( I can however provide support if you decide to
</I>&gt;<i> write it yourself.
</I>
I'm not directly working on any of these right now, but I certainly
have interest in experimenting with #2 &amp; #3.  #1 is interesting, but I
don't have direct need for it on my current projects.

Also, ditto on providing support :-)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best,
