<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> If we are satisfied with coroutine (cooperative) multitasking, I do not
</I>&gt;<i> think any additional threading support would be needed.
</I>
I am generally satisfied with that, but of course this varies a lot
with different application types.

&gt;<i> The thread type
</I>&gt;<i> which supports coroutines in standard Lua should be all we need, along with
</I>&gt;<i> interrupt handlers (IH) written in C.
</I>
There is generic interrupt support in eLua now for both C and Lua (in
trunk, will pe part of version 0.8 which is to be released soon).
Besides interrupt support, a mechanism for polling different interrupt
flags can be also implemented (think about a &quot;select&quot;-like call that
works on interrupt flags instead of file descriptors). This might be
just what you need in your coroutine. In would block in such a
&quot;select&quot; call waiting for a number of interrupts, one of them being a
timer expired interrupt (and it would yield if it receives this). This
can be extended to support generic events, not only interrupts. I
wouldn't do this &quot;event layer&quot; in C though, sounds more like a job for
the Lua side.

&gt;<i> The IH would set event flags and the
</I>&gt;<i> scheduler would use these flags to determine which coroutines are candidates
</I>&gt;<i> to be resumed. Rapin's basic idea is to enhance the yield method so it
</I>&gt;<i> specifies resume criteria (on serial reception, after 100ms, when a pin
</I>&gt;<i> changes state etc.). The scheduler (which as you suggest could be
</I>&gt;<i> generalised and written in C) starts all coroutines, so coroutines always
</I>&gt;<i> yield back to it. The scheduler could also be able to run Lua functions on
</I>&gt;<i> the primary thread, so combining coroutine scheduling with a simple event
</I>&gt;<i> handling paradigm (for example to hook up an LED to follow changing states
</I>&gt;<i> on an input pin). So the event abstraction comprises a boolean flag and a
</I>&gt;<i> list of functions and threads (coroutines). The flag can (optionally) be
</I>&gt;<i> connected to a specified &quot;interrupt port&quot; in the runtime. When the flag
</I>&gt;<i> becomes set (explicitly from Lua or by an IH), the scheduler executes the
</I>&gt;<i> functions and resumes the coroutines sequentially.
</I>
I believe this can be implemented in eLua even now with a bit of
coroutine/metamethod magic :) Except, of course, it will still be
cooperative.

&gt;<i> Very ambitiously, this scheme could perhaps even be extended to do hard
</I>&gt;<i> real-time. All the code segments would be profiled for minimum and maximum
</I>&gt;<i> execution time and the scheduler would use real-time critical path analysis
</I>&gt;<i> to guarantee specified event response time requirements (or raise an
</I>&gt;<i> exception if impossible). For this, the scheduler would have to take over
</I>&gt;<i> managing the garbage collector as well.
</I>
Sure, everything is possible :) I genereally don't believe in hard
real-time systems that are written in an interpreted language, most of
the time they prove to be more or less soft real-time in my
experience. That's not to say that it can't be done though.

Best,
Bogdan
