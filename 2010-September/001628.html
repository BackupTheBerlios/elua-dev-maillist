<PRE>&gt;<i> Hi Everyone
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have quite a few scientific instruments here. Almost all all of them use
</I>&gt;<i> Motorola's 68000 series or 6800 CPUs and a couple have old Intel based
</I>&gt;<i> microcontrollers(I forgot the models).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Being only 8 bit and 16 bit I have not attempted to load an eLua image right
</I>&gt;<i> into an instrument but I had another idea. I was thinking about using a
</I>&gt;<i> another microcontroller as an eprom emulator. If I had another eLua based
</I>&gt;<i> controller perhaps I could use the GPIO lines to respond to read requests
</I>&gt;<i> from the 16/8 bit 68K/6800 CPUs. If I could figure out a suitable
</I>&gt;<i> instruction to send when I wanted everything to hold then I could step
</I>&gt;<i> instruments through instructions very slowly. This might be a great tool
</I>&gt;<i> servicing them and might allow them to be used for unintended purposes.
</I>
I'm not familiar with the external bus on the 68k, but there are
basically two versions of such buses:

1. synchronous - the bus has a WAIT signal that can be asserted by the
memory subsystem (or other peripherlas) to indicate to the CPU that it
is holding the bus, and it should only read data from the bus after
WAIT is deasserted
2. asynchronous - in this case the bus cycle time is well known; this
is generally the case when accessing external memories (RAMs of Flash)

If you can relate to 1 above, your approach should work. For 2,
however, it's highly unlikely that you'll be able to generate a fast
enough bus cycle from eLua to fool the CPU. It'd be hard even from ASM
code, I imagine.
eLua aside, have you though about fiddling with the clock? A clock
generator is something very easy to build these days, and it should
allow you to run the CPU as slow as you want.

&gt;<i> Another thing I was thinking about was hijacking the instruments more
</I>&gt;<i> directly. Do you think if I asserted the Motorola's CPU halt that I could
</I>&gt;<i> then tap the inactive I/O lines with an Elua microcontroller. This would
</I>&gt;<i> give me access to prefabricated circuits for just about everything. I could
</I>&gt;<i> create some nice demos for PWM, LCD control etc...
</I>
Sure, if you keep the CPU in RESET you should be able to pretend it's
not there (at least on the general purpose I/O lines) and do whatever
you want with the rest of the circuit. But then you'll have to
physically connect things to the PCB, which might be easy or a damn
nightmare :)

Best,
Bogdan
