<PRE>Thanks Pedro, Thanks Bogdan

I have been working hard on putting together an eLua/Lua screencast 
series. I have several pieces put together now:

-ffmpeg/mencoder for video
-Audacity for sound
-Capture card for live video
-.srt files/mencoder for subtitles
-Geany text editor for integrated text editor and shell

The subtitle fonts are too large right now but after this is corrected I 
should be able to seamlessly record my voice, computer screen, demo 
board and other hardware and offer subtitles after post production too.

I have an instrument here called a refractive index detector. I think I 
will tap the I/O lines and create a demo video. This instrument has PWM 
for heating, analogue signals for light and temperature, and a solenoid 
that diverts flow for solvent flowing through it. This might be a good 
way to show people a bit about eLua and learn myself. I might also 
hijack another instrument called a fraction collector that is a little 
robot.

I move very slowly :(  I might not have anything to show for a couple of 
months.

Thanks again-Patrick

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> servicing them and might allow them to be used for unintended purposes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not familiar with the external bus on the 68k, but there are
</I>&gt;<i> basically two versions of such buses:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. synchronous - the bus has a WAIT signal that can be asserted by the
</I>&gt;<i> memory subsystem (or other peripherlas) to indicate to the CPU that it
</I>&gt;<i> is holding the bus, and it should only read data from the bus after
</I>&gt;<i> WAIT is deasserted
</I>&gt;<i> 2. asynchronous - in this case the bus cycle time is well known; this
</I>&gt;<i> is generally the case when accessing external memories (RAMs of Flash)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you can relate to 1 above, your approach should work. For 2,
</I>&gt;<i> however, it's highly unlikely that you'll be able to generate a fast
</I>&gt;<i> enough bus cycle from eLua to fool the CPU. It'd be hard even from ASM
</I>&gt;<i> code, I imagine.
</I>&gt;<i> eLua aside, have you though about fiddling with the clock? A clock
</I>&gt;<i> generator is something very easy to build these days, and it should
</I>&gt;<i> allow you to run the CPU as slow as you want.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Another thing I was thinking about was hijacking the instruments more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> directly. Do you think if I asserted the Motorola's CPU halt that I could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then tap the inactive I/O lines with an Elua microcontroller. This would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> give me access to prefabricated circuits for just about everything. I could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> create some nice demos for PWM, LCD control etc...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sure, if you keep the CPU in RESET you should be able to pretend it's
</I>&gt;<i> not there (at least on the general purpose I/O lines) and do whatever
</I>&gt;<i> you want with the rest of the circuit. But then you'll have to
</I>&gt;<i> physically connect things to the PCB, which might be easy or a damn
</I>&gt;<i> nightmare :)
