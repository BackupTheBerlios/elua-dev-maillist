I think I can even shave some code off of the RPC code if I go through  
and think about cleaning up the way it's set up with exceptions.  I  
have at least a few more critical todos on the list for that code,  
like at least making it so that it isn't necessary to open a serial  
link and do: lua\r rpc.server()\r to start it up. :-)

&gt;<i>  Another thing I've personally wondered about is whether inexpensive  
</I>&gt;<i> code or data compression algorithms might be usable?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> They're kinda useless in this case, I think, as you need to  
</I>&gt;<i> decompress your code somewhere. If you need to decompress to  
</I>&gt;<i> internal Flash, you made the problem worse, since you now have less  
</I>&gt;<i> space because of your compressed firmware. If you have external  
</I>&gt;<i> Flash and/or RAM, you probably don't have a space problem in the  
</I>&gt;<i> first place :) If you have external Flash you can execute from  
</I>&gt;<i> there, and the case of RAM &gt; Flash is quite rare in practice.
</I>
I'd assume you'd need some sort of MMU to make this work correctly,  
but I was thinking of something along the lines of a mechanism that  
would allow in-place usage, no LZ stream type stuff with a buffer. I'm  
thinking something like RLE &amp;/or additional pre-computed de- 
duplication with a static memory map.  Dictionary size might become a  
problem, but I'd assume there's a balance somewhere (and someone's  
probably done this before).  With this, you would have previously  
checked if there's duplicated code and the lookup would then just  
point to to the common definition of that.  This said, I assume you  
need hardware to make these sorts of acrobatics reasonable.

Also, it might be that a stream algorithm like ones derived from  
Lempel-Ziv could be useful for Lua bytecode or scripts if memory usage  
could be kept to a minimum.  It would be pretty easy to hook the chunk  
loading code to apply something like this when something is on its way  
in or out of the VM.  I think the benefits there might be worth it if,  
say, LZ77/LZ78 works with a rather tiny buffer size (256 bytes or 512  
bytes?).  Either that, or perhaps huffman coding if the entropy in  
code or bytecode is significantly less than 8 real bits of data per  
byte.

*shrug*  It's on my mind because I listened to this a few weeks ago,  
and there was some explanation of how these algorithms work: <A HREF="http://www.twit.tv/sn205">http://www.twit.tv/sn205</A>
