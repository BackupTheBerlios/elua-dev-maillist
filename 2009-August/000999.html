<PRE>Bogdan, no way I intended to disparage your superb work on eLua. Of course
it is an achievement of note to get this much functionality into such a
tight space. However in application terms it is still a platform not a
solution so actually using it in a real project is going to be limited by
only having a few tens of KB of application space. The more functionality
the platform offers the more we're going to want to do with it and the more
application space we'll need! 

 

Make no mistake, eLua will be great, but it just needs the hardware to
mature maybe another year or so to be ready for real-world application. Of
course the separate memory solution is viable for centralised architectures
with excellent boards like the Electrum, but then you are out of eLua's USP
- you have plenty of resources to run standard Lua on Linux.

I would not want my firmware to
be occupying 9/10ths of the available memory with the application grubbing
around in the last few KB!


Personally, I'd be quite OK with that if my firmware happens to be a quite
complete programming environment, including a programming language and its
corresponding virtual machine :)

Best,
Bogdan

John,

eLua with the default configuration and networking takes about 216 KB on
the Micromint Eagle boards. There are 8 KB reserved for the bootloader.
Swapping to the microSD card is normally not required. If your
application uses additional code beyond the remaining flash, one
alternative is to use the eLua configuration parameters to eliminate
functions that are not needed. 256 KB could be a limitation if your eLua
application also requires a medium size RTOS.

A constraint in the flash for the Micromint Eagle is the use of
TI/Luminary LM3S processors. They do not currently have a low cost 512KB
flash option. Yet that has not been a significant limitation for
customer applications. A large majority of standalone 32-bit embedded
applications that we have seen work well within 256 KB flash. In fact,
most 'C' applications can even add an RTOS and still have flash left.

We do have an AVR32-based controller in the works that will have the
option of 512 KB of flash, mainly because that option is available in
that MCU.

For applications with larger memory footprints we also offer an ARM9
controller with 64 MB of RAM and 512MB or 1 GB of NAND flash. It targets
applications using Linux but could be used for standalone applications
too. A new 400 MHz model of the Electrum line in the picoITX form factor
will be available for under $100 in about four weeks. I have not built
eLua for the ARM9 but will do at some point.

Regards,
Jesus Alvarez

mind. Although you can certainly run eLua as an academic or benchmarking
