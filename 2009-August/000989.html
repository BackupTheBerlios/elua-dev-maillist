<PRE>Thanks - yes, both good products! However there is an enormous gap in the
market between the two, at least in memory capacity. Unfortunately, for
eLua, the single chip options are still just a little tight in memory (both
flash and RAM) while the multi-chip ones work out too expensive (and
overkill) for the sort of radically distributed architectures I have in
mind. Although you can certainly run eLua as an academic or benchmarking
exercise in 256KB, as a practical engineer, I would not want my firmware to
be occupying 9/10ths of the available memory with the application grubbing
around in the last few KB!

Roll on ARM chips with 1MB Flash, 512KB RAM - that would really be an
enabler!

John,

eLua with the default configuration and networking takes about 216 KB on 
the Micromint Eagle boards. There are 8 KB reserved for the bootloader. 
Swapping to the microSD card is normally not required. If your 
application uses additional code beyond the remaining flash, one 
alternative is to use the eLua configuration parameters to eliminate 
functions that are not needed. 256 KB could be a limitation if your eLua 
application also requires a medium size RTOS.

A constraint in the flash for the Micromint Eagle is the use of 
TI/Luminary LM3S processors. They do not currently have a low cost 512KB 
flash option. Yet that has not been a significant limitation for 
customer applications. A large majority of standalone 32-bit embedded 
applications that we have seen work well within 256 KB flash. In fact, 
most 'C' applications can even add an RTOS and still have flash left.

We do have an AVR32-based controller in the works that will have the 
option of 512 KB of flash, mainly because that option is available in 
that MCU.

For applications with larger memory footprints we also offer an ARM9 
controller with 64 MB of RAM and 512MB or 1 GB of NAND flash. It targets 
applications using Linux but could be used for standalone applications 
too. A new 400 MHz model of the Electrum line in the picoITX form factor 
will be available for under $100 in about four weeks. I have not built 
eLua for the ARM9 but will do at some point.

Regards,
Jesus Alvarez
