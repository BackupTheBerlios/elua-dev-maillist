<PRE>&gt;<i> I think I can even shave some code off of the RPC code if I go through and
</I>&gt;<i> think about cleaning up the way it's set up with exceptions.  I have at
</I>&gt;<i> least a few more critical todos on the list for that code, like at least
</I>&gt;<i> making it so that it isn't necessary to open a serial link and do: lua\r
</I>&gt;<i> rpc.server()\r to start it up. :-)
</I>

I think we can define a new startup mode for this. Check the eLua boot
process here:

<A HREF="http://elua.berlios.de/beta/en/arch_overview.html#boot">http://elua.berlios.de/beta/en/arch_overview.html#boot</A>

The RPC mode is very useful, so I'd like to add a special compilation flag
for the &quot;boot eLua directly into RPC mode scenario&quot;. Sure, you could have a
/rom/autorun.lua with only &quot;rpc.server()&quot; inside, but this implies that
you'd need the ROMFS in the image, which is an unnecessary dependency.


&gt;<i> I'd assume you'd need some sort of MMU to make this work correctly, but I
</I>&gt;<i> was thinking of something along the lines of a mechanism that would allow
</I>&gt;<i> in-place usage, no LZ stream type stuff with a buffer. I'm thinking
</I>&gt;<i> something like RLE &amp;/or additional pre-computed de-duplication with a static
</I>&gt;<i> memory map.  Dictionary size might become a problem, but I'd assume there's
</I>&gt;<i> a balance somewhere (and someone's probably done this before).  With this,
</I>&gt;<i> you would have previously checked if there's duplicated code and the lookup
</I>&gt;<i> would then just point to to the common definition of that.  This said, I
</I>&gt;<i> assume you need hardware to make these sorts of acrobatics reasonable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I won't pretend that I fully understood what you said here :) Are we still
talking about compressing the eLua image itself? If so, my original point
still stands: you still need to decompress it somewhere, so having it
compressed and then decompressed will actually make the problem worse. If
you're thinking about &quot;on-demand decompression&quot;, then yes, you'd need a MMU,
and you won't find that in the targets currently supported by eLua.

Also, it might be that a stream algorithm like ones derived from Lempel-Ziv
&gt;<i> could be useful for Lua bytecode or scripts if memory usage could be kept to
</I>&gt;<i> a minimum.  It would be pretty easy to hook the chunk loading code to apply
</I>&gt;<i> something like this when something is on its way in or out of the VM.  I
</I>&gt;<i> think the benefits there might be worth it if, say, LZ77/LZ78 works with a
</I>&gt;<i> rather tiny buffer size (256 bytes or 512 bytes?).  Either that, or perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> huffman coding if the entropy in code or bytecode is significantly less than
</I>&gt;<i> 8 real bits of data per byte.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This, on the other hand, can make sense. Having something like a compressed
ROM file system filled with Lua scripts might save up some space.

Best,
Bogdan
