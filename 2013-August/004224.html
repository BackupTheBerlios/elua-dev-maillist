<PRE>
Some questions about few things that seem to be missing or work differently with the new build system.

All of the testing for this is on the LM3S platform (e.g. EK-LM3S8962).

1) How do I include the bitarray module in a build?
Under scons the bitarray module was included automatically.
Under the lua build system it is not included, and I have not figured out any way to get it included,
short of editing the build system files.
e.g. edit config/modules.lua
add
 &#160;bitarray = {},
under
 local elua_generic_modules = { 

2) Interrupt constants seem to be missing from cpu module.
If I build it with elua interrupts on, using scons the cpu module would have constants like cpu.INT_TMR_MATCH, 
with the lua build system these constants are not generated.

3) Why was linenoise turned off by default for the lm3s processors?
Not a big deal, since as long as one knows that it exists, one can turn it back on. &#160;
But I was curious if there was a particular reason to not use linenoise on the lm3s platform. &#160;

4) How do you make the new build system only compile the files you are actually using?
Even if you tell it to not use a particular module (e.g. i2c, or, as noted above bitarray, which is not used at all)
the lua build scripts still compile the .c file. &#160;Seems like a waste of time to keep recompiling things that are not
being used. &#160;I did not check to see if scons did this also, just used to build systems knowing enough to only
compile the files that are actually used by a particular target.

 &#160;Thanks
