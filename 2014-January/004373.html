&gt;<i> In Mihini's scheduler[<A HREF="http://www.eclipse.org/mihini/">http://www.eclipse.org/mihini/</A>], (the original inspiration for [e]lumen), we have a function using Lua's C API to do that.

In the eLua system there wouldn't be any other threads (unless the system was built with FreeRTOS). It would be just the &quot;main thread&quot; running the lua interpreter, and interrupt handlers that are invoked occasionally in reaction to hardware events.

</I>
I am fully aware of that. If the lua code is busy handling some previous event, the reaction to the next event has to wait until the processor is done with it. That is quite acceptable. One could still do the truly time-critical stuff within the interrupt handlers if necessary.

Essentially, a function needs to be provided that can be called safely from within an interrupt handler, which does the following:

1. Put a Lumen signal into the signal queue
2. If the lua code is waiting on the signal queue, release it, so that after returning from the interrupt handler, it will recheck the queue and find the new signal in there. In other words, arrange the scheduler to be run immediately after returning from the interrupt handler.

If this could be done in a way that is compatible with standard APIs, such as select(), even better.

Unfortunately, I am not familiar enough with the innards of the lua interpreter to tell how difficult this is.

Cheers
Stefan
