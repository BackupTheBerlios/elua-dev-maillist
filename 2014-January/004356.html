<PRE>
Some initial thoughts on the DAC interfaces. &#160;(Haven't fully digested, so will be more later).

Suggestions:

General thoughts:

Might be worth looking at i2s APIs to see what similar functions might be desirable. &#160;(Not saying need to do i2s now, just
makes sense to consider what an i2s eLua module might look like, since it probably has somewhat similar function to DAC.)

Might also look at some other libraries (e.g. Arduino audio library) for ideas on approach/functions that my be desirable.
(if haven't already done).

Interface described seems to only cover synchronous case, should extend to handle asynchronous (i.e. specify the DAC data
and then let the eLua program keep running, issuing control instructions as needed).
 &#160;So add procedures to start, stop, loop, clear buffer, set buffer length, etc.

Interrupt handling, buffering, etc. should probably be moved to the platform code, rather than having in the 
eLua module. &#160;The platform interface is at such a low level that could be hard to take advantage of special hardware on various platforms.
(Not clear how could use DMA, DAC interrupts, built in buffers, etc.)

Consider separating the scaling (offset, range adjustment, etc.) from the DAC code?
General purpose scaling lib./function, which can apply to data before presenting to the DAC. &#160;(I think Arduino library uses something similar.)
Could be useful elsewhere, e.g. in graphics, ADC, etc.
Do some DACs provide offset, etc. in hardware?


--
More specific:

Simplify this 
&gt;<i> num_samples_output, num_underflows = putsamples( dac_id, data_source, rate, [bits_per_sample, [channels, [bias, [timer_id]]]] )
</I>
to something like
num_samples_output = putsamples( dac_id, data_source )

Where data source can be any of the items you gave, or can be several numbers, or mix of the above.

so could say dac.putsamples( 0, 5, 9, 15, 25, 15, 9, 5)
To send the sequence 5, 9, 15, etc. to DAC 0.

Provide separate interface(s) to specify the other parameters (bias, timer_id, bits_per_sample, and rate are all likely to stay constant in most applications). &#160;(Also interface to get/reset number of buffer underflows.)
(If need to have interface that specifies everything, can add a function that combines all the setup plus the putsamples).

Rather than specifying frequency (rate), might make more sense to give period (1,000,000 / rate).
(Depends what various hardware needs, but no sense in requiring an expensive divide in the code if we can easily avoid it.)

Timer ID - look at how ADC handles timers. &#160;Make clear how to handle systems that do not need a timer for the DAC
(i.e. what should relevant functions return, etc.) &#160;Unlikely to need to change this for each call.

Provide interface to set size of DAC buffer (or at least make it a compile time configuration option).
(e.g. the 16 element buffer).

&gt;<i> &#160;bits_per_sample 8, 16, etc. (default is 8)
</I>Instead of defining this as 8, leave the default to be defined by the platform. &#160;If the DAC on a particular platform only does
12 bits per sample (e.g.), then it doesn't make sense to give it a default which can not work and always has to be changed.
(The module could provide a built in constant, something like DEFAULT_BITS_PER_SAMPLE, which informs the code what the default is.)

Caveat on this - if the intention is that the interface can provide data with a different number of bits than the platform's DAC
and that such data will be scaled to fit (e.g. if you give 8 bits but the DAC is 12 bits, then your data will be left shifted by 4 before
it is output, conversely if you provide 12 bit data but the DAC is only 8 bits, then it will shift right by 4 to throw away the excess
detail), then it should be clarified that such Procrustean scaling takes place automatically.
(In that case there probably should not be a default value, and the user should always specify the range of their data.)

Bitarray seems like another natural possability for storing/presenting the data to the DAC module. &#160;Might consider how to incorporate that cleanly.

Taking a function to generate the data to be written is nice. &#160;Could be nice to extend it a bit, accept a function that returns numbers (or a sequence of numbers). &#160;(e.g. if I want to generate a sine wave, how about if I feed it a sin function (with appropriate scaling, offset, and some kind of input generator, etc.)).


Using a bitmask in platform_dac_put_sample looks like it might be a bottleneck? &#160;May be hard to quickly decode a bitmask,
and at the moment that procedure is called for every sample going out to the DAC (so the decode is done a lot).
May not be much of an issue if only have 2 channels, but some audio applications use 6 channels, etc.

Is the added complexity really worth it (maybe offer simple version where specify 1 channel id, and complex version to use
when needed.)
One option is to have samples be tagged with which channel (e.g. in padding bits) - SAM3 does this in some cases.
Does STM do anything similar?
Have you considered varargs?


Once I look at adapting this to work with the SAM3 I may have other thoughts (what works well/doesn't work well with that
platform).

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: Re: [eLua-dev] DAC Module
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have reworked the DAC module and the Lua functions. The biggest change is that dac.putsamples() can now
</I>&gt;<i> be passed the sample data as either an array of integers, a string of bytes or a function that should return
</I>&gt;<i> a string of bytes every time it is called until all the data has been read when it should return an empty
</I>&gt;<i> string or nil.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> setup( dac_id, [bits_per_sample] )
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Initialise a single DAC (only required if you are going to call dac.putsample())
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;dac_id = id of DAC to initialise
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;bits_per_sample = 8, 16, etc. (default is 8)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> putsample( dac_id, val )
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Output a single sample to a DAC
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;dac_id = id of DAC to send output to
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;val = value to output
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> num_samples_output, num_underflows = 
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;putsamples( dac_id, data_source, rate, [bits_per_sample, [channels, [bias, [timer_id]]]] )
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Output a stream of samples to one or more DACs at a specific rate
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;dac_id = id of DAC to send output to
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;data_source = the source of the data to send to the DAC - can be either an array of integers,
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;a string of bytes or a function that returns a string of bytes - the function will be called
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;repeatedly until it returns nil or an empty string
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;rate = the sample rate in Hz
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;bits_per_sample 8, 16, etc. (default is 8)
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;channels = the number of channels (consecutive DACs) to output to (default = 1)
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;bias = a value that is added to each output value before it is written to the DAC (default = 0)
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;timer_id = the id of the timer used to generate the clock (defaults to 1st acceptable timer)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;returns 2 values, the number of samples output and the number of times buffer underflow occurred.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Note that dac.putsamples() calls dac.setup() so you don't need to explicitly call dac.setup() first.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ---------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have removed the wav playing function and written it in Lua, here's the bit of it that calls dac.putsamples():
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;local num_samp, num_uf = dac.putsamples(dac_id, function () return f:read(256) end, sample_rate, bytes_per_sample * 8, num_channels, 0x8000)
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;f:close()
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;print(string.format(&quot;%d samples output, %d underflows&quot;, num_samp, num_uf));
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ---------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As before, the code can be found at <A HREF="https://github.com/smartavionics/elua">https://github.com/smartavionics/elua</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
