THanks! :) Here's my 2c-worth (all negative, of course! :)

&gt;<i> The Lua interface currently looks like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> dac.init( id, [bits_per_sample, [options]] )
</I>&gt;<i> initialises a single DAC channel
</I>&gt;<i>   id = DAC channel id from 0 upwards (stm32f4 allows 0 or 1)
</I>&gt;<i>   bits_per_sample = 8, ... (stm32f4 allows 8, 12 and 16, only 12 bits
</I>&gt;<i>   actually used)
</I>&gt;<i>   options = platform specific option flags (currently unused)
</I>
All the other modules have functions called *.setup(), not *.init(),
so I guess this should be renamed.

I'm not sure that a place-holder for non-existent options is useful.
If, one day, extra options are needed, the implementer can add an
extra parameter with a default value of nil and that will be
backward-compatible with existing code.

Most other eLua functions have a way to request what the current
bits-per-sample are, and the usual eLua way is for the user to say
what they would like, then eLua sets the nearest possible value to the
number of bits you asked for, and return that as the value of the
setup function, the dac.setbitspersample() function or whatever.

That suggests:

actual_bits = dac.setup( id, [bits_per_sample] )
initialises a single DAC channel
    id = DAC channel id from 0 upwards (stm32f4 allows 0 or 1)
   bits_per_sample = 8, 12 and 16, only 12 bits
Returns:
   actual_bits = the actual number of bits per sample set to the DAC

I was wondering whether any hardware can have a different number of
bits per channel.
With other eLua interfaces, like pwm.setclock(id, freq) it lets you
setup the channels with different values if you like, then there is a
note in the platform-specific documentation to tell you that, for
example, on AVR32 all channels run from the same clock, so changing
one changes them all.

&gt;<i> dac.putsample( id, [val] )
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> outputs a sample to a DAC channel
</I>
&gt;<i>   id = DAC channel id
</I>&gt;<i>   val = integer value to load into DAC (default 0)
</I>
I'm not sure that having a default value is useful. I'd just make it a
compulsory 2nd argument. That would help people who forget to specify
the channel in their code, saying dac.putsample(sample) and this way
the error message would be that they have forgotten a parameter
instead of either outputting 0 on a random channel or saying &quot;invalid
channel&quot;.

&gt;<i> dac.putsamples( id, samples, rate, [timer_id, [bytes_per_sample, [bias,
</I>&gt;<i> [offset, [num_samples]]]]] )
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> outputs a sequence of samples to a DAC channel
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   id = DAC channel id
</I>&gt;<i>   rate = DAC update rate (samples per second)
</I>
Is this likely to change from call to call? If not, maybe it would be
more apt to put it in dac.setup()

&gt;<i>   samples = string containing sample data
</I>&gt;<i>   bytes_per_sample = number of bytes per sample (default 1)
</I>
I'm not sure about the string data type. There seem to be two idioms
in use in eLua already for variable sizes and number of parameters.
One is switching on the data type, which can be an integer, a string
or an array, the other is to put the samples as the last parameter and
allow any number of them. See i2c.write, which does both (!)

Going back to the string type, this means that if I have an array of
16-bit samples as numbers, I would need a bizarre code to chop each
sample into two bytes and compose a weird string.  Again, I think
using an array of integers seems less awkward.

Also, if we have bits-per-sample in the setup function, doesn't this
determine bytes-per-sample?

&gt;<i>   bias = value added to each sample before writing to DAC (default 0)
</I>&gt;<i>   offset = skip this many bytes at start of string (default 0)
</I>&gt;<i>   num_samples = number of samples to output (defaults to all samples in
</I>&gt;<i>   string)
</I>
Are these necessary? There is already a Lua idiom to select a
substring (or sub-array) from an existing sample buffer, without
replicating that functionality here.
That said, if we look at the existing adc module, that has
samples = adc.getsamples( id, count )
whish returns a table of integers, and
adc.insertsamples( id, table, idx, count )
to write samples into a sub-array of an existing table.  Maybe you
imitate this metaphor more closely in dac.*()?

&gt;<i> dac.playwavfile( id, wavfilename, [timer_id, [sample_buf_size]] )
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> plays a wav file (8 or 16 bit uncompressed PCM only) - currently only
</I>&gt;<i> one channel is output (mono) but it would not be difficult to output 2
</I>&gt;<i> channels for stereo.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   id = DAC channel id
</I>&gt;<i>   wavfilename = name of file containing wav data
</I>&gt;<i>   timer_id = id of timer to use (defaults to first timer that can be
</I>&gt;<i>   used)
</I>&gt;<i>   sample_buf_size = size of circular buffer used to hold samples
</I>&gt;<i>   (default 32)
</I>
Most eLua functions are more low-level than this. See i2c, for which I
suggested a higher-level interface to send an entire packet, but that
was rejected in favour of the existing bit-by-bit interface.
Also, opening files, and decoding wav-file-format has nothing to do
with a DAC module, but is a specific need for the audio or sound
effects that you need. For that, you could have a separete
wav-file-reading (and wav-file-writing!) module, returning (and
taking) arrays of integers - that would interface nicely with the ADC
module which would be able to save its results in files, and to the
DAC module which could take those arrays and play them, How does that
sound?

I assume that the critical issue for sound output is being able to
play audio in real time, for which having any Lua code running between
samples will make it too slow. Once you've read your WAV file into a
Lua table, you should be able to call dac.putsamples(id, table [,idx
[,count]]) to achieve the effects you need, with
samples=wav.read(file) as a support function.

Would that work for what you need to do?

&gt;<i> The platform API is simple: it basically consists of a function to init
</I>&gt;<i> a DAC channel, a function to output a single sample to one or more DAC
</I>&gt;<i> channels and a function to check whether a given timer OK to use as a
</I>&gt;<i> source of interrupts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> int platform_dac_init(unsigned id, unsigned bits_per_sample, unsigned
</I>&gt;<i> options);
</I>&gt;<i> void platform_dac_put_sample(unsigned channel_mask, u16 *data);
</I>&gt;<i> int  platform_dac_check_timer_id(unsigned id, unsigned timer_id);
</I>
OK. This is nice and clean.

Thanks, and sorry for turning the world upside-down for you!
