The purpose of the timeout is to wake-up tasks that went to sleep for a 
set amount of time (like the blinker task in the test.lua), or are 
waiting for signals with a timeout set. The call to sched.wait() returns 
with a value that is the time you have available for your task before 
some other task needs to do something. So if you have some other task 
busy-looping this timeout value will be 0, but it they are idle 
(sleeping or waiting) the timeout will be a positive number you can 
safely use for whatever you want, for example go to low power mode.

&gt;<i> I think there must be a

That is achieve by waking the lua environment, which will continue on 
running and proceed to pick the data and emit signals.

&gt;<i> I acknowledge that you may not be keen on coding this in C, as you want

</I>
That's what my proposal does: when there are no lumen tasks to run (they 
all are waiting for something), go to sleep mode, and when that sleep is 
interrupted, immediately pick from lua and signal whatever happened. 
Perhaps a more expanded pseudocode can explain it better:

sched.run(function ()
   while true do
     local _, timeout = sched.wait()

     if timeout==0 then
       -- some task is busy-looping, so must return straight away:
       -- read the data of interest, and emit sched.signal() as needed
     else
       -- set a timer to wake me timeout in the future
       -- enable interrupts (timer and anything needed)
       -- go to sleep (low power mode)
       -- i was waken!
       if not waken_on_timeout then -- there was a data interrupt
         -- read the data of interest, and emit sched.signal() as needed
       end
     end

   end
end)


If this works, it will be great! :)

Jorge
