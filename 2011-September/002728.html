I'll take a look at it tonight.  I thought I had built an image using
the same toolchain and config options the day before, but perhaps I
made a mistake.

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wonder if anyone has tried to create an AVR Studio 5 project using the

</I>
I've not installed AVR Studio 5 before, but to my understanding it
should contain avr32-gcc and much of the cross-compiling toolchain.
To that you would likely just need to add Lua and maybe a native
compiler for your platform depending on what you need to build (Python
is somewhat optional now).  What platform are you on?

Regarding making it into a Studio 5 project, I suppose you could just
import all the headers and files into a project and compile, with some
modifications to pass appropriate defines to the compiler and possibly
some other things.  Some things definitely would not work though like
dynamically constructing the romfs filesystem and some of our plans to
overhaul the configuration system to make it a bit simpler to select
compile-time options.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Once i understand eLua better maybe i will give it a try.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regarding the eLuawebserver, this sure has great potential but something
</I>&gt;<i> is not working well on my system. Things like the Ajax demo that only
</I>&gt;<i> changes a few parameters like &quot;Light&quot;, works really well, and is quite
</I>&gt;<i> fast, but updating pages from sd card is very slow as described before,
</I>&gt;<i> and if you let the webserver run for a while, it locks up and you have
</I>&gt;<i> to reset the board to get things back. Not sure what that is.
</I>
Again, I can't speak much to that fork or expected performance with
it.  When I experimented with it a bit, I experienced some similar
difficulties.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, i very much appreciate your help in &quot;getting started &quot;
</I>
No problem.  I'm sorry there seem to be so many hurdles in getting the
basics going.  I'll put up an image after I've checked that it's
working on my EVK1100.

Best.
