<PRE>OK, I've put in replacement files.  I'm not sure what's different,
perhaps I just copied the wrong set of files the first time but these
came up different in terms of contents and the serial console came up
for me (didn't have time for more extensive testing tonight).  Files
are located at the same urls.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hello James
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Again, thank you for taking the time to help.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I tried to load your &#160;generic elua files to my EVK1100 board.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I had no problem programming or verifying the flash image, but i get
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> no prompt's and it accepts no input.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The best i can tell is i just get a null &#160;0x00 or BREAK sent out the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> serial port to the terminal emulator program.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe when you get some time you can just verify that it does work ok on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> your board and system. At least that will give me confidence that the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> image i have works on someones board.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll take a look at it tonight. &#160;I thought I had built an image using
</I>&gt;<i> the same toolchain and config options the day before, but perhaps I
</I>&gt;<i> made a mistake.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also just to make sure, i ran another app that uses the serial port on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the EVK1100 and it works just fine, so there is no hardware issue that i
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can find on my end.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I wonder if anyone has tried to create an AVR Studio 5 project using the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> elua source directory install ? This would make debugging a lot easier.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Studio 5 lets you create links to existing files, so the download of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> source directory structure could stay in tack, and a studio 5 project
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could link to all the revelent source files needed to build,run and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> debug the project for the AVR32 platform.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I understand the need for a common build platform to support the many
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> other platforms for eLua, but Since Studio 5 is free and it supports
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> AVR32 and should be able to use the eLua source download as is, it would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> make things a lot easier.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've not installed AVR Studio 5 before, but to my understanding it
</I>&gt;<i> should contain avr32-gcc and much of the cross-compiling toolchain.
</I>&gt;<i> To that you would likely just need to add Lua and maybe a native
</I>&gt;<i> compiler for your platform depending on what you need to build (Python
</I>&gt;<i> is somewhat optional now). &#160;What platform are you on?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regarding making it into a Studio 5 project, I suppose you could just
</I>&gt;<i> import all the headers and files into a project and compile, with some
</I>&gt;<i> modifications to pass appropriate defines to the compiler and possibly
</I>&gt;<i> some other things. &#160;Some things definitely would not work though like
</I>&gt;<i> dynamically constructing the romfs filesystem and some of our plans to
</I>&gt;<i> overhaul the configuration system to make it a bit simpler to select
</I>&gt;<i> compile-time options.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Once i understand eLua better maybe i will give it a try.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Regarding the eLuawebserver, this sure has great potential but something
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is not working well on my system. Things like the Ajax demo that only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> changes a few parameters like &quot;Light&quot;, works really well, and is quite
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fast, but updating pages from sd card is very slow as described before,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and if you let the webserver run for a while, it locks up and you have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to reset the board to get things back. Not sure what that is.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, I can't speak much to that fork or expected performance with
</I>&gt;<i> it. &#160;When I experimented with it a bit, I experienced some similar
</I>&gt;<i> difficulties.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Again, i very much appreciate your help in &quot;getting started &quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No problem. &#160;I'm sorry there seem to be so many hurdles in getting the
</I>&gt;<i> basics going. &#160;I'll put up an image after I've checked that it's
</I>&gt;<i> working on my EVK1100.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best.
