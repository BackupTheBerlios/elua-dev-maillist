<PRE>Hi James

Well the files still do not work on my system.
I downloaded the updated hex and elf files that you provided.
I have no problem programming the flash with these files but i still get
no
output on the serial port and no responses from inputs.
I compared the new files to the original and their are differences, so i
think that
confirms i have the new files.

Since this image works on your EVK1100 i guess ill have to try to figure
out why it does not work on my setup.

Just to confirm your set up.
1. you connect your terminal program to uart0 ( i have tired both )
2. you set terminal for 115.2k N 8 1  no flow control ( I have tried
other combinations)
3. if you press the reset button on the board you get the prompt or if
you just power cycle the board you get the prompt ?  ( i have tried both
with no results )

I checked my hardware again and other applications have no problem
communicating thru the serial uart comm ports to the terminal program.

I will try to figure this out.
I will also try to install the tool chain.
Can you tell me the command line and options you used to build this
image ?

thanks again for your help ?

PS... can you tell me why when i respond to your emails it seems to
start a new thread with the same subject line, but when you respond your
reply goes to the proper thread when viewed thru the web archive ?  I
just &quot;reply all&quot; to the email message i get from you, but apparently
that does not work as i expected.

Ken
