Yep. It runs quite well on 9B92, supporting all the periphs that we
already already support on LM3S.

</I>
I can try and answer questions.
&gt;<i> dac
</I>We don't yet have a DAC module for eLua, though it wouldn't be too
hard to implement at least something that would set values on the DAC
with a command from eLua.

&gt;<i> rit screen
</I>We support an OLED display found on some of the other eval boards,
it's connected to an SPI peripheral on those.  It looks like its a
different display than the one on some of the other kits where we've
supported the display since it's 96x16 as opposed to 128x64.  I
suspect it won't be hard to get going though.

&gt;<i> sd card
</I>If this is connected to an SPI line as with some of the other LM3S
eval boards, it should be pretty straightforward to get running.  As
with the simplest case for the display, this may require a little
modification to get things working.  Going from just looking at the
schematic, it looks like it uses SSI0, so I think we'd just need to
enable the options for this particular board for this to work.

&gt;<i> motor controllers
</I>This depends on how these are set up and whether they're using a
peripheral we already support or not. If they're on PWM, that might be
fairly easy.  If they're using encoder interfaces, we haven't added
support for that peripheral yet. Again, a quick look at the schematic
suggests that they're using PWM0 and PWM1 to drive the motors. I'd
have to look a little deeper at the motor driver to know whether that
will be usable out of the box or not.

I'm a little busy trying to wrap up some stuff at the moment, but I
can try helping to make some of the adjustments for things we already
support, and make some recommendations for how one might get the other
functionality going.  Certainly with the DAC, some C code will need
writing :-)

I would suggest maybe either starting with a stock image for the
EK-LM3S9B92 board to experiment with (SD card is off for this one, as
is display). If they provide some sort of virtual UART functionality
through another chip you should be able to get the eLua console up.
We could work our way from there.
