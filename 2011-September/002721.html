This is likely correct, it looks like SER_MUX defaults to being
enabled for those targets.

</I>
It looks like there's a bug for AVR32 where even if that option is
deselected it's still enabling something of that functionality.  I'll
file a bug report for this, it may have something to do with the
alternate location for where platform configuration data is stored for
avr32 targets.

It looks like it also doesn't generate the .hex file that is
convenient for use with.

I don't have an AT91 board, but in attempting the same for that
platform, it seems that it also has that defaulted to enabled and on
the web builder toggling the options for this don't appear to have an
effect, so it appears that there's an issue there as well.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any suggestions or can someone tell me how i can get a pre built image

</I>
In the interim, I can generate an image for you out of trunk if that
would be helpful.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would also like to find a prebuilt image of eLuawebserver for the
</I>&gt;<i> EVK1100 if that is available. I only see a link to a complete source
</I>&gt;<i> repository. But i do not have the toolchain available to build any of
</I>&gt;<i> these images or even the mux.exe that might be needed if i have to work
</I>&gt;<i> with sermux enabled.
</I>
Hopefully we can get that corrected in the builder shortly, though I
think the version of eLua that's being used on the builder (the last
release of 0.8) might not support networking.  This is now in the main
trunk.

As far as eLuaWebServer is concerned, you might need to communicate
with Nuccio regarding what differences there are there vs what is in
trunk, since that version seems to have some specialized configuration
options that I'm not familiar with, but here's a build straight out of
those sources:
<A HREF="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/169337/elua_lualong_at32uc3a0512.elf">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/169337/elua_lualong_at32uc3a0512.elf</A>
<A HREF="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/169337/elua_lualong_at32uc3a0512.hex">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/169337/elua_lualong_at32uc3a0512.hex</A>

Based on the sources, I believe that it will try to use a static IP of
192.168.1.10.  When I tried quickly testing it with a FAT32 SD card
that was lying around, it seems to at least load up with the files
copied to an SD card.  NOTE: I'm not sure whether we currently work
with SDHC cards of large sizes, when I tried this with an 8 GB card it
wouldn't work, but another 4GB card I had lying around did.

Hope that helps.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I tried reading all i could find, but now i am stuck.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> any suggestions or links would be appreciated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks
