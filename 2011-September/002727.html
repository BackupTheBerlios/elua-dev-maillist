I have not used RFS on a dedicated serial line extensively, but have
encountered some issues while using RFS with SERMUX to share a serial
line where I would get some hanging, which I wasn't able to narrow
down satisfactorily.  I think this may have more to do with SERMUX
than RFS and It may be that this was due to USB-&gt;Serial cable I was
using being unshielded and experiencing noise that was causing
corruption of communications.  Bogdan might be able to speak to more
extensive experiences with stability/maturity.

LuaRPC has been pretty stable for me when I've used it for some
long-running tasks, especially when set to boot into RPC mode.  I've
also used it in some looping code where a function is executed
periodically on the MCU, and then between iterations it checks for
waiting RPC data.  I believe there might be a pending commit or two
for making the latter easier to do which I'll try and integrate
shortly along with usage examples.  One caveat: do not print on the
MCU side if you have RPC set up on the same line as the console UART.

In short: RFS on a dedicated serial line may be stable/mature (others
would need to chime in).  RPC is pretty stable/mature as long as you
don't output anything else to the serial line being used for RPC.

Some additional notes, just for reference:
There is also MMCFS (SD card w/ FAT) and it should probably also be
possible to get the &quot;semifs&quot; semihosting support that I wrote for mbed
FS to work for other ARM targets with a debugger active to access the
debugger's filesystem, but I haven't explored making semihosting work
any any other context than mbed.
