hum. yes, their os.time() and os.date() routines are bizarre, since
they don't handle the time and the date respectively (!).
time() reads the system date and time and returns it as a coded number
or converts from the a table {year, month, day, hour, min, sec} to the
coded representaton, while
date() does basically the opposite.  What strange naming!

As regards avoiding pulling in too much C library, I think we get
gmtime() and mktime() anyway because some RTCs store the time
internally as separate fields (e.g. DS1337) while systems without an
RTC chip will count time linearly in some way, such as counting a
systick interrupt, so I think we have to be able to convert between
coded time and tables anyway.

&gt;<i> I guess what I was getting at was just that if we have to pick a
</I>&gt;<i> locale for handling both printing (&quot;%x&quot; or &quot;%X&quot;) and maybe parsing
</I>&gt;<i> that instead of supporting all the possible locales out there, we just
</I>&gt;<i> pick a sane one that's a standard.
</I>
The manual says that
&quot;the representations for %x, %X, and %c change according to the locale
and the system.&quot;
so I think here we have a free hand. The order of the fields in ISO
8601 has the advantage of being unambiguous everywhere, while any
choice of mm/dd/yy or dd/mm/yy will be wrong somewhere. Not to mention
being Y2K-bugged.
Who designed this awful part of the Lua library?!
Sadly, the examples in PIL print dates with slashes XX/XX/XX XX:XX:XX
whereas ISO 8601 advocates hyphens XXXX-XX-XX XX:XX:XX.
Since no program could ever read and understand the output of %c or
%x, given its variability, I think we can call it human-readable only,
so can do what we want.
I suggest YYYY-MM-DD and HH:MM:SS as per ISO

&gt;<i> Presumably we would support all the
</I>&gt;<i> other formatting options to get individual components into a string.
</I>&gt;<i> It looks like Lua uses strftime for handling those (which is in
</I>&gt;<i> Newlib, not sure how much code size it takes up).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, I guess there are a couple things here:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) For os.date do we support all that strftime usually provides,
</I>&gt;<i> including locales, ditto but with a fixed locale, or just the table
</I>&gt;<i> format?
</I>
I'd make os.date() exactly the same as standard Lua (well, just enable
os.date() in the Lua source - it makes no calls to the OS). That way
more standard Lua code will work in eLua.
Locales are not an option for us due to their size - 6MB on Unix - so
isdst is always returned false (or just undefined==nil==false) and we
can just ignore it if they pass it to os.time(table).

&gt;<i> 2) For os.setdate do we support all the formatting options for date
</I>&gt;<i> strings including locales, ditto but with a fixed locale, or just the
</I>&gt;<i> table format?
</I>
There are locales (language options such as date-printing order and
whether floating point values are printed with a dot or a comma at the
decimal point) and there are also timezones (when to apply daylight
saving time, how many hours to offset from UTC).
I don't think an embedded target has space for tables of timezones
(6MB) or for language options (either.

Parsing date strings is not a requirement. Nothing in Lua does this,
it's incredibly complex and we don't have locale information (language
tables are  (timezone tables for isdst are 6MB on Unix) to be able to
do it.

At the Lua level, I suggest os.settime() either:
1)  take a coded value, the same thing that os.time() returns, so that
os.settime(os.time()) is (almost) a no-op and if a program wants to
set the date and time using separate fields, it can use
os.settime(os.date(table)),
2) or take either a number or a table and do the implicit call to
os.date() for you.
I'd tend towards the simpler option 1).

I suppose the C platform layer should decide on one format, which I
guess is the system-dependent number, as returned by os.time().

&gt;<i>&#160;I suppose
</I>&gt;<i> we could provide options as we do for other things though for targets
</I>&gt;<i> with smaller flash availability?
</I>
You mean BUILD_OSDATE or something?  I think, if a program deals in
time/date at all, it's probably because it wants to display it
somewhere.  Making the whole time/date subsystem conditionally
compiled might make more sense, since eliminating it all that drops
all the gmtime()/mktime() stuff as well.

There is other stuff in the os library too:

os.clock() (elapsed time since the program started - fairly easy to
implement once you have time/date stuff)
os.difftime(t1, t2) - pretty easy if our coded numbers are in seconds.

and I was already thinking of implementing the os library's file
operations for systems with an mmc card:
os.remove(filename)
os.rename(oldname, newname)
os.tmpname()

but commenting out the lines that map those functions at the end of
loslib.c should be enough until the day we inplement them.


As regards code size, attached are versions of mktime() and gmtime()
which use a sophisticated algorithm but don't do timezones. The newlib
versions are pretty dumb, just looping from year to year, adding month
sizes and testing for leap years, while these calculate the answers
directly. Including these in the build replaces the ones in newlib and
is 1700 bytes smaller (oh, and faster :). If you also disable the
handling of negative times in this code (for dates  before 1970), you
save another 68 bytes.

You'll also want to remove the call to localtime() in
src/lua/loslib::os_date().  Or provide a stub in the file that just
calls gmtime().

  if (*s == '!') {  /* UTC? */
    stm = gmtime(&amp;t);
    s++;  /* skip `!' */
  }
  else
    stm = localtime(&amp;t);

but I suggest leaving the &quot;!&quot;-skipping code, again so that standard
Lua programs or libraries are more likely to work in eLua.
