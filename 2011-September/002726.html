<PRE>Hello James

Again, thank you for taking the time to help.
I tried to load your  generic elua files to my EVK1100 board.
I had no problem programming or verifying the flash image, but i get
no prompt's and it accepts no input.
The best i can tell is i just get a null  0x00 or BREAK sent out the
serial port to the terminal emulator program.

Maybe when you get some time you can just verify that it does work ok on
your board and system. At least that will give me confidence that the
image i have works on someones board.

Also just to make sure, i ran another app that uses the serial port on
the EVK1100 and it works just fine, so there is no hardware issue that i
can find on my end.

I wonder if anyone has tried to create an AVR Studio 5 project using the
elua source directory install ? This would make debugging a lot easier.
Studio 5 lets you create links to existing files, so the download of the
source directory structure could stay in tack, and a studio 5 project
could link to all the revelent source files needed to build,run and
debug the project for the AVR32 platform.

I understand the need for a common build platform to support the many
other platforms for eLua, but Since Studio 5 is free and it supports
AVR32 and should be able to use the eLua source download as is, it would
make things a lot easier.

Once i understand eLua better maybe i will give it a try.

Regarding the eLuawebserver, this sure has great potential but something
is not working well on my system. Things like the Ajax demo that only
changes a few parameters like &quot;Light&quot;, works really well, and is quite
fast, but updating pages from sd card is very slow as described before,
and if you let the webserver run for a while, it locks up and you have
to reset the board to get things back. Not sure what that is.

Again, i very much appreciate your help in &quot;getting started &quot;

Ken
