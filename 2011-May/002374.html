<PRE>I don't think .NET MF is comparable to eLua.  Although I haven't used the
Micro Framework, I have used both .NET (mostly VB.NET) and interpretive
languages (a Python/VB6 combo) extensively, with many machines using both
approaches in the field.  The real .NET comparable to Lua isn't C#,it's Boo,
IronPython, or IronRuby.

If I had to choose between VisualStudio and its debugger or a high level
interactive language (such as Python or Lua) with no IDE, I'd choose the
latter.  Using an interactive system is a great way to both learn new
hardware and to debug; my Python/VB6 code is setup so I can access all the
Python objects via the interpreter, and thus I can interactively test, look
at the results, try something, check out the new results, and so on.

The comparable for VisualStudio also isn't eLua, but other IDEs such as
Eclipse, Netbeans, Code Composer Studio (based on Eclipse) and MPLAB X
(based on Netbeans).  I don't think VS is any better than those -- and many
of these are now cross platform.  JTAG isn't such a big deal now;
stand-alone JTAG interfaces are pretty reasonable for many architectures
(heck, TI has open sourced the XDS 100), and are included on most
development kits.

I think the eLua cross-platform approach is correct; for example, the
selection of .NET MF chips and boards available from GHI and Netduino is
quite limited.  The NXP (GHI) and Atmel (Netduino) chips are nice, but are
missing some pretty cool peripherals available on the eLua supported STM32
and Stellaris.  BTW, GHI's pricing for their chips is reasonable; a
USBizi100 is $16.95; the LPC2387 is $13.44.

However, although most modern MCUs are supplied with a lot of software (e.g.
StellarisWare), I can see why the .NET MF is a good choose for some
situations: I'm quite sure it's much simpler to get started in VisualStudio
+ C# + GHI/Netduino than IDE (Eclipse,etc) + C/C++ + assorted supplied and
open source libraries.

BTW, at first I confused the FEZ Panda board with the PandaBoard (
pandaboard.org ); they're quite different animals.
