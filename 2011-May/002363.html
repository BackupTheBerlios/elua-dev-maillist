<PRE>I would not personally emphasise the language, the debugger or even the
absolute performance as the key issues. Other things being equal, these
would be important. However at this stage of the game, for me, the important
thing is being able to write a real, useful microcontroller application in a
single chip. So the key things are:

 

1. All the hardware I/O features of the chip should be accessible to the
high-level language and well documented.

 

2. There should be support for multitasking and event response in the
high-level language.

 

3. Memory use (RAM and EPROM) must be frugal enough so you can fit real
applications in on-chip memory.

 

I accept eLua has a difficult challenge due to trying to support lots of
different chips and boards, but is that the right decision? Microcontrollers
are a chip-per-application proposition, so we can afford to buy the chip
that supports the software rather than trying to make the software support
all the available chips.

I didn't want to jump to conclusions, but I was somewhat presuming
that both of these might be the case.  I figured that the .NET VM
would still end up being somewhat slower than Lua's, and I was curious
about whether or not they had managed to come up with some way to make
it as simply extensible with C modules.


&gt;<i> Also as a language, Lua is significantly easier to learn (for newbies) and

</I>
I can't speak to this directly (since I haven't written anything of
great length or significance in C#), but I would figure that the
syntax and a primarily functional language like Lua + the REPL might
be easier to teach with.

</I>
This is something I'm not sure if anyone (including myself) on the dev
team is familiar with.  Is there a demo of this somewhere to show how
this works without getting the hardware?  If you look at the roadmap
on the site you'll note there's a &quot;Lua debugging (remote/on target)&quot;
item, and while I think  we know we have some of the components we
might need for such a tool, I'm not sure we've decided what it will
look like (aside from not OpenOCD+gdb ;-) ).

 

I think the OP was talking about high level debugging (debugging Lua code),
not the very low level stuff one can do with OpenOCD+gdb. This isn't hard in
itself:

 

<A HREF="http://www.keplerproject.org/remdebug/example.html">http://www.keplerproject.org/remdebug/example.html</A>

(there are other examples out there. A simple Lua debugger is almost trivial
to write using the &quot;debug&quot; library).

 

The main issue here is presentation. What most people have come to expect
when they hear about debuggers is something integrated with a GUI where they
can easily do stuff like breakpoint management, variable tracing, program
control (on/off/step) and so on. A command line debugger is easy to write,
not that easy to use. Without such a GUI and giving the dynamic nature of
eLua I believe it's actually more efficient to simply add couple of &quot;print&quot;
statements around the code and interpret the output. 

On the other hand, I believe the GUI debugger should be a simple UI over the
command line debugger (just like gdb+associated GUIs) so we'll have to do
the command line version anyway.

 

Best,

Bogdan
