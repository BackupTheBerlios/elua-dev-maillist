<PRE>I've been asked the same question many times over the past few months, Why eLua on a FEZ board? Why? Stupid or something?&#160; Why PIC32 open source port using gcc? ;)
I think the goals for eLua and MicroFramework are the same:
- Support for a high level language with source level debugger
- Easy environment to develop applications.&#160; 

- Board support packages for boards

eLua is a a pure open source embedded project:
Code:&#160; 

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; - Core code.&#160; Kernel, makefile system, etc.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; - Good documentation on the code base

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; - BSP(Board Support Package), drivers,&#160; libraries (TCP/IP, USB, crypto(SSL), etc.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 


Packaging eLua:

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; - Having eLua already loaded on hardware to allows the end user to start writing applications out of the box, no porting, no creating a BSP. No issues with voiding support or warranty if loading different binary, etc.&#160; eLua is already on the board, why load anything else?&#160; ;)
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; - Upgrade firmware with web, or simple interface
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

Just image if&#160; .NET Micro Framework did not run on the FEZ boards? 

What if mbed, just had simple examples? No web development tool to compile apps, no drivers, no framework, etc.&#160; Would it sell?&#160; 

Why does microchip do so well? Offers a complete package, drivers, source, boards and chips.

FYI, Microsoft stopped support for .NET Micro Framework. It is hard sell Micro-framework for $5 a board, when the board is only $5.&#160; But package&#160; .NET Microframe work with hardware, it is a good combination, great out of the box experience.&#160; Same holds for Arduino, great HW with development tools, i.e. GUI, libraries etc.&#160; 


I think having eLua run on FEZ boards will offer .NET Micro framework developers a new tool to help develop applications. Does it compete with C#? It offers a different way to program.&#160; Just like using Python instead of C#, both are programming languages but offer different ways of doing it.&#160; 


It will take time to have complete package.&#160; 

I've got my work cut out to deliver a&#160; complete FEZ port, documentation, loader etc.&#160; eLua has a place holder on the GHI web site at <A HREF="http://wiki.tinyclr.com/index.php?title=ELua">http://wiki.tinyclr.com/index.php?title=ELua</A> 


Hope this email makes more sense than some of my others as of late....

Actually, the problem with eLua not having better device driver
&gt;<i>support (which is already very good) is because it's incredibly harder
</I>&gt;<i>to make modules which work in a single way for multiple boards.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>You see, FEZ can have good device drivers because they have only a
</I>&gt;<i>bunch of boards, with the same or very similar chips, which usually
</I>&gt;<i>have the same way of doing things.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes. Kind of the difference between Windows and OS X on an incredibly smaller scale :) All joke aside, I sometimes question the decision of making eLua as portable as possible instead of focusing on one or two platforms at most (from a project management perspective, that is). Most of the time I don't though. Going from general to particular is generally easy, the other way around is much harder.&#160;
&#160;
eLua supports multiple chips, with multiple architectures, each having
&gt;<i>multiple peripherals, some that perform the same way, but are
</I>&gt;<i>configured differently. That said, the eLua team tries very hard to
</I>&gt;<i>make to abstract all that away, in favor of the user. With that, one
</I>&gt;<i>can use the same code in different boards. So, if a developer starts
</I>&gt;<i>with one board and finds he needs more processing power in the middle
</I>&gt;<i>of the application, he won't have to port all of his code, as long as
</I>&gt;<i>he used the hardware abstraction layer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I, myself, prefer to write C code for my projects (haven't had time to
</I>&gt;<i>learn to code Lua yet), but I like eLua's idea very much and keep a
</I>&gt;<i>look at how things go.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Hopefully you'll be able to work with C code inside eLua much easier in the not-so-distant future.

Best,
Bogdan

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> How to put this delicately ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've noticed a lot of activity with people using FEZ boards (like the Panda)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and baseline .NET MF boards like the NetDuino for eLua. What advantages do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you see with eLua over using the .NET MF environment they are designed for?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm afraid that having tried hard to get off the ground with eLua and also
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with the MBED environment, I bought a FEZ Domino and found the .NET
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> environment (particularly with the GHI Electronics FEZ extensions) very much
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more capable than either. I'm now actually writing application code rather
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than trying to get device drivers working! Have you guys run into
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> limitations that are causing you to go with eLua or is it just for the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> challenge of doing things from scratch?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I wish eLua well and hope it will soon get up to the level of functionality
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> offered by FEZ, which I think should serve as a benchmark for what needs to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be achieved. I like the following features:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. You can buy single chips with the runtime already loaded and so do not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> require a JTAG or other specialist development hardware to get going.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. Unlike MBED, it is a genuine single-chip solution using on-chip USB
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> resources for its development link.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3. There is a free development system with support for both emulated and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> target debugging (although I am actually using the paid-for Visual Studio
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2010 as I already had that).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4. There are libraries / device drivers for all the I/O resources on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> chips as well as for TCP/IP using an external chip. This includes more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> esoteric stuff like CAN and SD Card file systems. There is also full USB,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> both device and host.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 5. Multitasking is natively built-in.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Set against this, I would prefer the elegant minimalism of Lua to the rather
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bloated C# and full non-commercial open source would be preferable to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Corporate open source compromise, but for the moment, the other advantages
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> outweigh this.
