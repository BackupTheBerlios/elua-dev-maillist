<PRE>Actually, the problem with eLua not having better device driver
support (which is already very good) is because it's incredibly harder
to make modules which work in a single way for multiple boards.

You see, FEZ can have good device drivers because they have only a
bunch of boards, with the same or very similar chips, which usually
have the same way of doing things.

eLua supports multiple chips, with multiple architectures, each having
multiple peripherals, some that perform the same way, but are
configured differently. That said, the eLua team tries very hard to
make to abstract all that away, in favor of the user. With that, one
can use the same code in different boards. So, if a developer starts
with one board and finds he needs more processing power in the middle
of the application, he won't have to port all of his code, as long as
he used the hardware abstraction layer.

I, myself, prefer to write C code for my projects (haven't had time to
learn to code Lua yet), but I like eLua's idea very much and keep a
look at how things go.

&gt;<i> How to put this delicately ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've noticed a lot of activity with people using FEZ boards (like the Panda)
</I>&gt;<i> and baseline .NET MF boards like the NetDuino for eLua. What advantages do
</I>&gt;<i> you see with eLua over using the .NET MF environment they are designed for?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm afraid that having tried hard to get off the ground with eLua and also
</I>&gt;<i> with the MBED environment, I bought a FEZ Domino and found the .NET
</I>&gt;<i> environment (particularly with the GHI Electronics FEZ extensions) very much
</I>&gt;<i> more capable than either. I'm now actually writing application code rather
</I>&gt;<i> than trying to get device drivers working! Have you guys run into
</I>&gt;<i> limitations that are causing you to go with eLua or is it just for the
</I>&gt;<i> challenge of doing things from scratch?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wish eLua well and hope it will soon get up to the level of functionality
</I>&gt;<i> offered by FEZ, which I think should serve as a benchmark for what needs to
</I>&gt;<i> be achieved. I like the following features:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. You can buy single chips with the runtime already loaded and so do not
</I>&gt;<i> require a JTAG or other specialist development hardware to get going.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Unlike MBED, it is a genuine single-chip solution using on-chip USB
</I>&gt;<i> resources for its development link.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. There is a free development system with support for both emulated and
</I>&gt;<i> target debugging (although I am actually using the paid-for Visual Studio
</I>&gt;<i> 2010 as I already had that).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4. There are libraries / device drivers for all the I/O resources on the
</I>&gt;<i> chips as well as for TCP/IP using an external chip. This includes more
</I>&gt;<i> esoteric stuff like CAN and SD Card file systems. There is also full USB,
</I>&gt;<i> both device and host.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5. Multitasking is natively built-in.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Set against this, I would prefer the elegant minimalism of Lua to the rather
</I>&gt;<i> bloated C# and full non-commercial open source would be preferable to the
</I>&gt;<i> Corporate open source compromise, but for the moment, the other advantages
</I>&gt;<i> outweigh this.
