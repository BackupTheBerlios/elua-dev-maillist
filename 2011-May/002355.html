</I>&gt;<i> limitations that are causing you to go with eLua or is it just for the
</I>&gt;<i> challenge of doing things from scratch?
</I>
I think it's a bit of both.  To start, when I started working with
eLua things like .NET MF were either not yet available or were just
starting to be discussed and hadn't really materialized.
Unfortunately, we don't have the same sort of plug-and-play GUI IDE
toolchain at this point that an environment like .NET MF might offer,
and for the platforms we support we may not have full peripheral
coverage for every device.  We have these sorts of things as goals,
but we haven't yet reached them.

That said, while it's not perfect, I'm fairly happy with it to use as
a development environment and as a testing tool for a lot of purposes,
and given my familiarity with the guts of it it's fairly easy to
extend, port or fix if there are problems I run into.  I'm also really
not that interested in getting locked into using .NET, when what I've
got is mainly licensed under just about the most permissive license in
existence :-)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wish eLua well and hope it will soon get up to the level of functionality
</I>&gt;<i> offered by FEZ, which I think should serve as a benchmark for what needs to
</I>&gt;<i> be achieved. I like the following features:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. You can buy single chips with the runtime already loaded and so do not
</I>&gt;<i> require a JTAG or other specialist development hardware to get going.
</I>
This is somewhat inherent to supporting lots of hardware and currently
not having a platform that's shipping with eLua as a &quot;preferred&quot;
development environment.  While there's not anything that is currently
available for order at the moment, there are projects like the Mizar32
that are in progress that will make things like this a lot easier.

mbed is also pretty easy to load eLua on and the filesystem is
supported, but not all the device drivers are fleshed out :-)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Unlike MBED, it is a genuine single-chip solution using on-chip USB
</I>&gt;<i> resources for its development link.
</I>
With the proliferation of support for USB profiles, this is something
that I would like to see in eLua as well.  By supporting CDC on some
platforms we would even get USB&lt;-&gt;Serial for free out of the box, and
then we could build on top of that for a fast native link for
transferring data.  I suspect one of the reasons why we haven't really
jumped on this is uneven support on the MCU-side for this type of
interface.  Aside from supporting the obvious CDC link, I'm not sure
what the obvious protocol choice would be.  I suspect we'd pretty much
end up inventing one, or somehow building on top of the multiplexer
work to provide a transparent high speed multiplexing serial link?

Having hacked on some libusb code recently, I actually wouldn't be too
afraid of fiddling with adding some sort of USB link.  It'd be great
to take advantage of some of the built-in features that USB provides
out of the box.

That said, this is generally on a wish list more than a must have list
for me :-)


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. There is a free development system with support for both emulated and
</I>&gt;<i> target debugging (although I am actually using the paid-for Visual Studio
</I>&gt;<i> 2010 as I already had that).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I'm glad to see that there's at least some free/open support for this
platform on it's way through Mono.

I assume you're referring to the Visual Studio Express product however?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4. There are libraries / device drivers for all the I/O resources on the
</I>&gt;<i> chips as well as for TCP/IP using an external chip. This includes more
</I>&gt;<i> esoteric stuff like CAN and SD Card file systems. There is also full USB,
</I>&gt;<i> both device and host.
</I>
We're fairly good here (aside from USB) on platforms like LM3S, but
other platforms are more variable.  We do have CAN (on LM3S &amp; STM32)
as well as FatFs on SD cards (via SPI, so any platform that has
working SPI should be able to access SD cards connected to an SPI
peripheral).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5. Multitasking is natively built-in.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Is this cooperative or preemptive?  Lua certainly has cooperative
multitasking built-in.  eLua also now has the ability to provide some
more primitive preemptive multitasking through the early-stage
interrupt support.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Set against this, I would prefer the elegant minimalism of Lua to the rather
</I>&gt;<i> bloated C# and full non-commercial open source would be preferable to the
</I>&gt;<i> Corporate open source compromise, but for the moment, the other advantages
</I>&gt;<i> outweigh this.
</I>
Fair enough :-) It's awesome to get a complete solution out of the box
that &quot;just works&quot; and is inexpensive. I certainly really enjoyed the
first time I pulled an Arduino out of the box and found how easy it
was to just plug it in and use any of numerous ready-made examples and
libraries.  I personally don't know enough about the implementation of
the C# microframework to know where it falls down in comparison to Lua
and where it excels aside from what you've mentioned to us.

We're certainly trying to make it a better development tool to make
our own lives easier and so that other people might find it useful as
well.  I think some of the things you've mentioned are certainly on
the roadmap or are things that we'd love to see as well, like some
simple easy to order, load and develop with hardware that doesn't
require a JTAG programmer (though, to be fair quite a number of the
supported platforms either have integrated bootloaders, have
integrated JTAG and/or have simple GUI tools for flashing even if the
integrated flashing interface is JTAG (LM3S/TI for example)).

Also, if you do have gripes or suggestions like this, I think we're
always happy to have discussions about them.  I don't think anyone
here is likely to start a flame war over criticism. Lua is not a
religious language, it's full of compromises and it's a very pragmatic
language.  Likewise, I think a lot of the people on this list are
probably fairly pragmatic as well :-)
