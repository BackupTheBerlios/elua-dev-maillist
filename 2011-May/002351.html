<PRE>How to put this delicately ...

 

I've noticed a lot of activity with people using FEZ boards (like the Panda)
and baseline .NET MF boards like the NetDuino for eLua. What advantages do
you see with eLua over using the .NET MF environment they are designed for?

 

I'm afraid that having tried hard to get off the ground with eLua and also
with the MBED environment, I bought a FEZ Domino and found the .NET
environment (particularly with the GHI Electronics FEZ extensions) very much
more capable than either. I'm now actually writing application code rather
than trying to get device drivers working! Have you guys run into
limitations that are causing you to go with eLua or is it just for the
challenge of doing things from scratch?

 

I wish eLua well and hope it will soon get up to the level of functionality
offered by FEZ, which I think should serve as a benchmark for what needs to
be achieved. I like the following features:

 

1. You can buy single chips with the runtime already loaded and so do not
require a JTAG or other specialist development hardware to get going.

 

2. Unlike MBED, it is a genuine single-chip solution using on-chip USB
resources for its development link.

 

3. There is a free development system with support for both emulated and
target debugging (although I am actually using the paid-for Visual Studio
2010 as I already had that).

 

4. There are libraries / device drivers for all the I/O resources on the
chips as well as for TCP/IP using an external chip. This includes more
esoteric stuff like CAN and SD Card file systems. There is also full USB,
both device and host.

 

5. Multitasking is natively built-in.

 

Set against this, I would prefer the elegant minimalism of Lua to the rather
bloated C# and full non-commercial open source would be preferable to the
Corporate open source compromise, but for the moment, the other advantages
outweigh this.
