The viral component they're referring to is specifically targeted at
the GPL, however there are some GPL-based projects that do include the
LM3S drivers, including a high profile one like FreeRTOS, although
they're fairly explicit that certain files that they redistribute are
not covered by the GPL:
<A HREF="http://www.freertos.org/license.txt">http://www.freertos.org/license.txt</A>

We don't imply that we're changing the license terms of the
manufacturer provided header files, although admittedly sine if the
text on our site isn't quite as explicit was what's stated on the
FreeRTOS licence, we do note this:
&quot;Manufacturer provided CPU support libraries are licensed under their
own terms. Check src/platform/platform-name for details of each
license.&quot;

LM3S also has a requirement that their files not be reused on hardware
other than their own and a few other limitations that make theirs one
of the most complicated licenses associated with peripheral support
and headers found among our supported platforms.  They've had this
license since before they got absorbed into TI, and I don't believe
they've made any indication that they're planning to change it in the
mean time, though I wish they would.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We had this problem with the first version(s) of eLua which were GPL.&#160;GPL is
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;viral&quot; in the sense that it touches other code that is distributed together
</I>&gt;<i> with GPL code..&#160;Then we switched to MIT (mostly because of licenses such the
</I>&gt;<i> one above). IANAL (NDIEWTBO) but the MIT license is as liberal as it gets:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License#License_terms">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License#License_terms</A>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe this lets us redistribute their code as long as we specify that
</I>&gt;<i> parts of the eLua code are copyrighted under different terms (and of course
</I>&gt;<i> we do that). I hope I'm not wrong about this one.
</I>
I don't think the licenses are incompatible so long as we don't
replace their copyright, change their terms or attempt to relicense
the files.  The MIT license doesn't really care about that.  The GPL,
on the other hand, might not like being distributed with the LM3S
license due to the GPL's &quot;no additional restrictions&quot; clause. So I
think the LM3S license and the GPL are actually mutually incompatible
without explicit modification.

So, IANAL (NDIEWTBO either), but I generally think we're OK.  If
anything we could be perhaps more explicit in how we describe which
files are under which license.  Also, Luminary is quite aware of the
project, has donated hardware to test on, and they've even mentioned
eLua on their site and some of their dev kit packaging.

&gt;<i> Best,
</I>&gt;<i> Bogdan
