Exactly, those should not be infinitely deep. So I'm still confused.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Sure. But the reason I'm trying to keep it small in other platforms
</I>&gt;<i> (even
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; with the risk of stack overflows) is the lack of memory. Mizar32 doesn't

</I>
Of course it depends on your optimization goal. So far it was always space
in detriment of speed for me.


&gt;<i> I confess I am confused by the assertion that simple and newlib can't

</I>&gt;<i> - SRAM+SDRAM is markedly faster than just SDRAM: about 10% for 20

</I>&gt;<i> - You can allocate and access 100K of junk in a table when using

</I>&gt;<i> and inspection of the code seems to show that the newlib allocator in

</I>&gt;<i> from all blocks listed in MEM_{START,END}_ADDRESS, while the simple
</I>&gt;<i> allocator also does this explicitly in its code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
'newlib' and 'multiple' are actually the same allocator: dlmalloc (
<A HREF="http://g.oswego.edu/dl/html/malloc.html">http://g.oswego.edu/dl/html/malloc.html</A>). In the early days, when the first
embedded eLua targets were brought to life, Newlib didn't have a dlmalloc
version that supported non-contigous memory spaces (or it couldn't be
compiled to support non-contigious memory spaces, I can't remember the exact
reason) so I added a newever version of dlmalloc (that didn't have this
problem) to the source tree. The only problem was that the newer version was
also larger so I kept it as a separate option. Quite a bit of time have
passed since then though and by your claims it seems that things have
changed in Newlib. Thanks! I'll take a look at this when I have some time.
On a somehow related note, I'll integrate your emBlod patch in the eLua
mainline as soon as (you guessed it) I have some time, which should me this
week. Again, sorry for the delay.

Best,
Bogdan
