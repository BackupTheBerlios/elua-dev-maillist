The basic idea is that different platforms have different ways of
setting up sequencing/scanning of channels (and some provide minimal
hardware support for scanning/sequencing).  All the channels that have
pending samples should be scanned sequentially when conversions are
triggered.

platform_adc_update_sequence() updates the hardware so that channels
are marked as enabled in hardware and pins will be configured
correctly for acquisition.  It does this based on what channels
currently have pending sample requests for a given ADC.

In the ADC interrupt, if we are running at the end of a sequential
acquisition (looks like AVR32 is configured this way), we then roll
through the channels we expected to have conversion results from,
check if there is a conversion result and if there is we put it into
our sample buffer.  If &quot;smoothing&quot; is enabled and we haven't yet
gotten enough samples to provide an average of the requested smoothing
length number of samples, the sample we just captured gets sucked into
the circular smoothing buffer (summing and averaging takes place when
samples are actually requested from the eLua side).  Next if we have
enough samples from the channel we're currently working with, we
update our bookkeeping to mark it as no longer pending samples and not
active in the sequence.  Then we move onto the next channel to get a
sample from.

At the end of collecting and preliminarily processing the acquired
samples, we update our hardware sequence to reflect the bookkeeping we
did earlier that might have removed some channels.  Finally, depending
on whether we're using a clock or running as fast as possible we might
kick off the next conversion in software or re-enable the ADC's clock
triggering and we wait until the next round.

If you can let me know under what conditions you're getting the errant
samples, I can try looking into it.  If you're getting samples from
the wrong channel inconsistently, it may be that somehow the internal
bookkeeping for what channels are active vs what's going on in
hardware.  I'm a little miffed though since we do an adc_check_eoc()
to confirm a ready sample, and it looks like we're doing things
correctly with putting things into the correct buffer.

I'll have to refresh my memory on some of the AVR32 hardware details,
but if you can recall the conditions that cause the problem (just
sampling on 8 channels?  or sampling different counts on these?
increasing/decreasing the number of channels being sampled from at
once?) you're seeing I can try to reproduce it locally and then maybe
also test it with some other similar hardware to try and help narrow
down whether it might be in the platform code or in the common code.

Also, is this with the code currently in the repo or with modifications?
