</I>&gt;<i> Ah, great. That answers a lot of my questions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, if you get through the connect phase, it probably at least did a

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, The initial header exchange works.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, I ran into a few

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It would be nice to know if it gets into rpc_dispatch_helper(L,

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When I tried debugging, the control did not go through case: RPC_CMD_CALL.

</I>
Hmm.. that's interesting, and certainly tells us a bit about where
things might be stuck.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I suppose I stripped out the debug code, so that would need to be
</I>&gt;<i> added in to display this on the fly on the desktop side. &#160;I can put
</I>&gt;<i> this back and make it optional if you're not familiar enough with the
</I>&gt;<i> code to put some instrumentation in?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The debug code would be of great help. I'm using term for a quick display of
</I>&gt;<i> events happening on the server side.
</I>
OK.  I'll look into sticking some of that back in.  At different
points I would have it spit out some details about generally what it
was doing as well as sometimes doing dumps of all the data that was
being sent.  It sounds like even just full dumps might be useful since
it bails/hangs so early.

You can add to the transport_write_buffer and transport_read_buffer to
watch each message that's received/sent from the perspective of the
desktop machine quite easily.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Do you have any suggestions for me ?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I could put up my test branch online. (Where can I put the code ?) Is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> someone willing to work on this ? I could use some help.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd be more than willing to take a look at it.
</I>&gt;<i> Awesome. I was involved with github for the SWIG project. I'll fork eLua, do
</I>&gt;<i> the changes and request a pull.
</I>
OK.  I believe I should see this in my messages on GitHub when you do so.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One more thing:
</I>&gt;<i> I went though the previous post describing the issues with elua_uip.c
</I>&gt;<i> Will this interfere with the performance of RPC over ethernet ?
</I>&gt;<i> Do we have to do anything about this before ?
</I>
Well, I'm not sure.  I haven't used TCP/IP on eLua a whole lot and so
I'm not that familiar with the failure or problem modes that have been
experienced.  I think I understand a little of how they might happen
based on what Bogdan has mentioned to me about what he's working on
(which should improve functionality and add UDP support).

I think that ultimately we might be best off if we can make it work
with a stateless protocol like UDP, and handle missing data or failed
data exchanges within LuaRPC, which is fairly careful about sending
data back and forth (hence things like RPC_READY, which prevent the
sender from just dumping lots of data to the microcontroller without
knowing if there's a ready and waiting buffer).  I believe that Bogdan
is also fleshing out the UDP support within eLua a bit more with his
branch, and he has mentioned that RFS runs very well over this
transport.

I suspect that we should definitely be able to make it work on top of
the TCP/IP, even as it is now, but if if is causing the failures
you've currently been experiencing then we may have some more definite
test cases for areas where the networking support needs improvement.

I'm quite happy to see you jumping into working on LuaRPC over TCP/IP
however since I have planned to do this for some time, I just haven't
had enough micros with ethernet on them that I was needing it to use
with projects.
