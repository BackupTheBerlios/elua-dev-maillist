many thanks for writing

&gt;<i> setting up sequencing/scanning of channels
</I>
Sorry, can you help me understand what you mean by &quot;sequencing&quot; in this context?
I understand &quot;scanning&quot; to mean &quot;go and see which ADCs have completed
their conversions and go and collect the results&quot;, but am not sure
what kind of sequence is suggested here. Maybe I'm being too finickity
with the language?

Thanks, your explanation makes sense, and corresponds with the code I've seen.

&gt;<i> If you can let me know under what conditions you're getting the errant
</I>&gt;<i> samples, I can try looking into it.
</I>
I'd heard a rumor that simultaneous acquisition from the AVR32 ADCs
might be dodgy, so I have 8 trimmers on the 8 ADC channels and am
trying that out.  The code looks fine, but I am finding that some
channels report the voltage supplied on different channels, sometimes
consistently, sometimes sporadically. In the first tests, with the
existing code, channel 0 responded to the pot connected to channel 1
and channel 1 gave the same result as channel 7, responding to the pot
on channel 7.  The results for different combinations of channels were
weird, see <A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/mizar32/issues/detail?id=42">http://code.google.com/p/mizar32/issues/detail?id=42</A>

Like you say, the code looks fine: all 8 channels are just 8 identical
register sets in a straight line and 8-bit fields in various control
registers. I found that it was running the ADC out of spec (7.5MHz
instead of &lt;=5) but correcting this only changed things - what made a
difference was fixing the sample-and-hold time, which should be 600ns
but it only almost works when set to 1333ns. Sadly, making it longer
than this, which should be more reliable, makes it much worse - most
of the channels report the value from channel 7.

However, a debugging printf reveals that the erroneous behaviour is
always accompanied by one or more calls to adc_configure(), whereas
while it is working (almost) smoothly, it does not repeatedly call
this function... except once every 50 samplings or so, exactly
coinciding with when it gets the wrong value on ADC0.  That suggests a
timing-dependent issue, something to do with which channels have
completed conversion and which haven't when the interrupt routine
fires.

&gt;<i> &#160;If you're getting samples from
</I>&gt;<i> the wrong channel inconsistently, it may be that somehow the internal
</I>&gt;<i> bookkeeping for what channels are active vs what's going on in
</I>&gt;<i> hardware.
</I>
That's the symptom. I'll see if I can understand the bookkeeping stuff.

&gt;<i> but if you can recall the conditions that cause the problem (just
</I>&gt;<i> sampling on 8 channels? &#160;or sampling different counts on these?
</I>
I haven't got getsample() to work at all, so I'm just asking for one
sample from each channel, then getting them with adc.getsample() using
variations on:

while true do
  adc.sample({0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7},1)
  for id = 0,7 do
    io.write (id ..&quot;:&quot;..adc.getsample(id)..&quot; &quot;)
  end
  io.write(&quot;\n&quot;)
end

&gt;<i> I can try to reproduce it locally and then maybe
</I>&gt;<i> also test it with some other similar hardware to try and help narrow
</I>&gt;<i> down whether it might be in the platform code or in the common code.
</I>
You'll need to do some hardware hacking to be able to verify it, since
the EVK1100 only has one pot and you really need to look at all 8 to
see what's going on. If you have a Mizar32 and a protoboard, this is
very easy :) see attachment

&gt;<i> Also, is this with the code currently in the repo or with modifications?
</I>
Yes, I'm using the mainline git code and a Mizar32 with 256KB flash.
I currently only maintain a set of patches for the 120K version of the
firmware, visible in our google code repo, which disable a load of
non-essential stuff to make space for all the eLua modules except net.

Thanks again for the clues
