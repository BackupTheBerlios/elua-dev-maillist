</I>
We're scanning through a sequence of channels that have requested
samples. Depending on the hardware you can sometimes control the order
of the sequence, but usually I'm just aiming to put them in order from
low channel number to high channel number.  A trigger initiates a
scan, which runs through a sequence of channels that are multiplexed
to the ADC.

So, essentially what I mean by sequencer is hardware or software that
controls the order of channel acquisition, which in almost every case
I try to keep in numerical order low channel to high channel.

Thanks for the added details below.  I didn't get a chance to put
together a full setup yesterday, but I'll try to test something either
during the day with the 128k version I have on hand or tonight with
the EVK.  Given the symptoms you're describing it sounds like either
the hardware is being a bit weird about when/where it's putting
certain things or when I wrote the driver for this platform I made
some assumptions about the hardware behavior that cause a breakdown
between the software bookkeeping and the hardware state (I have some
theories now that we've had some discussion). If the issue is on the
latter side of things, it shouldn't be too hard to fix.  If it's
weirdness in hardware we might have to change the approach used in
setting up the ADC maybe to not use the hardware sequencer and do it
in software instead.  This isn't too problematic if we have to do it,
it just increases the number of times the interrupt will be called if
one is sampling on multiple channels.

Meanwhile, I'll take a look at getsamples as well since that
_shoudn't_ have anything to do with the platform code, and I can't
think of a good reason why that should have broken since I haven't
touched the common code for that in quite some time.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks, your explanation makes sense, and corresponds with the code I've seen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If you can let me know under what conditions you're getting the errant
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> samples, I can try looking into it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd heard a rumor that simultaneous acquisition from the AVR32 ADCs
</I>&gt;<i> might be dodgy, so I have 8 trimmers on the 8 ADC channels and am
</I>&gt;<i> trying that out. &#160;The code looks fine, but I am finding that some
</I>&gt;<i> channels report the voltage supplied on different channels, sometimes
</I>&gt;<i> consistently, sometimes sporadically. In the first tests, with the
</I>&gt;<i> existing code, channel 0 responded to the pot connected to channel 1
</I>&gt;<i> and channel 1 gave the same result as channel 7, responding to the pot
</I>&gt;<i> on channel 7. &#160;The results for different combinations of channels were
</I>&gt;<i> weird, see <A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/mizar32/issues/detail?id=42">http://code.google.com/p/mizar32/issues/detail?id=42</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Like you say, the code looks fine: all 8 channels are just 8 identical
</I>&gt;<i> register sets in a straight line and 8-bit fields in various control
</I>&gt;<i> registers. I found that it was running the ADC out of spec (7.5MHz
</I>&gt;<i> instead of &lt;=5) but correcting this only changed things - what made a
</I>&gt;<i> difference was fixing the sample-and-hold time, which should be 600ns
</I>&gt;<i> but it only almost works when set to 1333ns. Sadly, making it longer
</I>&gt;<i> than this, which should be more reliable, makes it much worse - most
</I>&gt;<i> of the channels report the value from channel 7.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, a debugging printf reveals that the erroneous behaviour is
</I>&gt;<i> always accompanied by one or more calls to adc_configure(), whereas
</I>&gt;<i> while it is working (almost) smoothly, it does not repeatedly call
</I>&gt;<i> this function... except once every 50 samplings or so, exactly
</I>&gt;<i> coinciding with when it gets the wrong value on ADC0. &#160;That suggests a
</I>&gt;<i> timing-dependent issue, something to do with which channels have
</I>&gt;<i> completed conversion and which haven't when the interrupt routine
</I>&gt;<i> fires.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160;If you're getting samples from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the wrong channel inconsistently, it may be that somehow the internal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bookkeeping for what channels are active vs what's going on in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hardware.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's the symptom. I'll see if I can understand the bookkeeping stuff.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but if you can recall the conditions that cause the problem (just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sampling on 8 channels? &#160;or sampling different counts on these?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I haven't got getsample() to work at all, so I'm just asking for one
</I>&gt;<i> sample from each channel, then getting them with adc.getsample() using
</I>&gt;<i> variations on:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> while true do
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;adc.sample({0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7},1)
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;for id = 0,7 do
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;io.write (id ..&quot;:&quot;..adc.getsample(id)..&quot; &quot;)
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;end
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;io.write(&quot;\n&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i> end
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I can try to reproduce it locally and then maybe
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> also test it with some other similar hardware to try and help narrow
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> down whether it might be in the platform code or in the common code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You'll need to do some hardware hacking to be able to verify it, since
</I>&gt;<i> the EVK1100 only has one pot and you really need to look at all 8 to
</I>&gt;<i> see what's going on. If you have a Mizar32 and a protoboard, this is
</I>&gt;<i> very easy :) see attachment
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also, is this with the code currently in the repo or with modifications?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I'm using the mainline git code and a Mizar32 with 256KB flash.
</I>&gt;<i> I currently only maintain a set of patches for the 120K version of the
</I>&gt;<i> firmware, visible in our google code repo, which disable a load of
</I>&gt;<i> non-essential stuff to make space for all the eLua modules except net.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks again for the clues
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;M
