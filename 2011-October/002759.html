FYI, there is already desktop socket code here:
<A HREF="https://github.com/jsnyder/luarpc">https://github.com/jsnyder/luarpc</A>

Oops. I didn't check on this before. I will use this on my test branch.

This doesn't actually send anything over the wire.  The way subtables
of the slave work is that they create helpers that can replay indexing
over the wire when an action is requested like calling a function
(call) or assignment (newindex).  I suppose we could check these
things when the helpers are created, but the slave/server will return
errors if it can't index remotely when you try an operation that does
require communication.

Ah, great. That answers a lot of my questions.

So, if you get through the connect phase, it probably at least did a
header exchange to establish the connection.

Yes, The initial header exchange works.

&gt;<i> However, I ran into a few
</I>&gt;<i> problems: pio.pin.setdir(###) does not return. It goes into a waiting
</I>&gt;<i> state.
</I>&gt;<i> I am sure the file descriptor returned by elua_accept(###) is valid. While
</I>&gt;<i> tracing through the code, I realized that the state does not enter
</I>&gt;<i> read_cmd_call(###). I can only wonder if there&#8217;s a problem with the code
</I>&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;<i> transport_open_listener(###).
</I>
It would be nice to know if it gets into rpc_dispatch_helper(L,
handle).  Does the client send an RPC_READY back to the server?  I'm
guessing it does if it gets to that function at all and gets to a hung
state.

When I tried debugging, the control did not go through case: RPC_CMD_CALL.
So, it doesn't send back the macro value to the server.

I suppose I stripped out the debug code, so that would need to be
added in to display this on the fly on the desktop side.  I can put
this back and make it optional if you're not familiar enough with the
code to put some instrumentation in?

The debug code would be of great help. I'm using term for a quick display of
events happening on the server side.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you have any suggestions for me ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I could put up my test branch online. (Where can I put the code ?) Is
</I>&gt;<i> someone willing to work on this ? I could use some help.
</I>
I'd be more than willing to take a look at it.
Awesome. I was involved with github for the SWIG project. I'll fork eLua, do
the changes and request a pull.

One more thing:
I went though the previous post describing the issues with elua_uip.c
Will this interfere with the performance of RPC over ethernet ?
Do we have to do anything about this before ?

Awaiting your response.
Raman
