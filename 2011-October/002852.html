<PRE>Hi,

I have implemented (and merged into the master branch) a new eLua feature:
the system timer. It attempts to fix one of the biggest flaws in the eLua
design: timer management (I take full blame for this BTW). The documentation
was updated (so you can read more about this in the official docs), but this
is the summary: I was obviously wrong when I assumed that manual timer
management can actually work in practice. It can (and most of the time will)
become a nightmare for anything but the simplest applications. Having to
manually track timers and their base frequencies is prone to failure and
endless frustration. The system timer is my attempt to fix this. It is a
timer with a *fixed, unmodifiable resolution on all platforms *(1us) and
large counters:

- 52 bits for floating point Lua and 64-bit integer only Lua (lualonglong, a
new feature). In this mode the system timer overflows after about 142 *years
*(I know this is hard to believe, so feel free to do the math yourselves :)
)
- 32 bits for 32-bit integer only Lua (lualong). In this mode the timer
overflows after about 1 *hour* (yes, huge difference here).

The eLua API was subsequently modified to take advantage of this new
feature. I'll say this again: *part of the eLua API was modified to take
advantage of the system timer, *so be sure to check the updated docs. You
can find a list of the changes below):

- the timeouts are specified in a much more unified manner across different
eLua modules. Their general specification is now *[timeout],
[timer_id]** *(note
that the order of 'timeout' and 'timer_id' was changed in many modules) with
the following semantics:

Timeout                    |          Timer ID                |     Result
=============================================================================================================
0                          |   not relevant                   | no timeout
(the function returns immediately).
PLATFORM_TIMER_INF_TIMEOUT |   not relevant                   | the function
returns whenever it's ready, it might block indefinitely
A positive number          |   not specified                  | the system
timer is used to measure the specified timeout
A positive number          |   an actual timer ID             | the
specified timer is used to measure the specified timeout

As you can see,* the general idea is that you should be able to specify any
timeout without having to worry about a timer ID*; if you don't specify a
timer ID it will default to the system timer.
The main modules affected by this change are *tmr, uart *and *net*.


- you don't have to specify the various timer IDs (CON_TIMER_ID,
RFS_TIMER_ID, RPC_TIMER_ID) in platform_conf.h now. If you don't specify
them, they'll automatically default to the system timer. In fact you *
shouldn't* specify them explicitly unless you have a very good reason to do
so.
- note the new *PLATFORM_TIMER_INF_TIMEOUT *constant used to specify an
infinite timeout. This is an &quot;universal constant&quot; across eLua now; this
means that different modules don't get to specify their own constants for
infinite timeout anymore (as was the case, for example, with UART and its
PLATFORM_UART_INFINITE_TIMEOUT constant); they must use
PLATFORM_TIMER_INF_TIMEOUT instead.

You can (and are encouraged to) use the system timer from C code too, not
only from Lua code. You can reffer to the system timer with the
*PLATFORM_TIMER_SYS_ID
*constant. Unlike the Lua API, the C API (the platform interface) was only
modified slightly (with the exception of the timers API that was enhanced
quite a bit). In particular, the order of timeout and timer_id parameters
was *not* changed in the C API.

One important limitation of the system timer is that it *can't generate
interrupts*.

&gt;<i>From an implementation standpoint, this is how the system timer is
</I>implemented on different platforms, in a nutshell:

- all Cortex-M3 platforms use the SysTick timer for the system timer
implementation. This has a minimum impact on the Lua code since the SysTick
timer was not exported to Lua. This will also be applicable on M4 platforms.
- AVR32 'steals' a PWM channel for the system timer implementation (since
the timer block in AVR32 was simply too weak to implement this feature).
- AT91SAM7X uses the PIT timer (again, minimal impact since this timer was
not exported to Lua).
- LPC24xx 'steals' one of its hardware timer for the system timer
implementation
- STR9 'steals' one of its hardware timers for the system timer
implementation
- i386, str7 and lpc288x do *not *implement a system timer. Note that since
all timer IDs have a tendency to default to the system timer this might lead
to problems (this was documented explicitly). These platforms are seldom
used and will probably be declared obsolete in the near future, so the
effort for implementing a system timer was not justifiable. If you actually
use one of these platforms please contact me and I'll see what I can do.


You can find a more in-depth overview of the system timer and its
implementation in the documentation
(arch_platform_timers.html#the_system_timer).
I hope I'm not forgetting anything here. Please don't hesitate to contact me
if you have questions. Also, I encourage all of you to test this new feature
as much as possible, as it is still very much in beta.

Best,
Bogdan
