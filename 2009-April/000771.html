Yeah, I'm not sure why that was the case.  I didn't do that much  
testing though, so I may be missing something.

Sorry I didn't post it over the weekend into the main repository.  For  
some reason I was getting some weird issues with git-svn not wanting  
to create the branch for me.  I know why it's complaining, but I  
didn't get around to fixing the issue.  I'll do so in the next few days.

The code is up here if you don't mind browsing in git:
<A HREF="http://github.com/jsnyder/elua/tree/cocobranch">http://github.com/jsnyder/elua/tree/cocobranch</A>

I did not include the examples that come with coco.  Many of them will  
probably just blow up if you run them straight without modification.   
Try reducing the number of coroutines created to 10 and then ramp it  
up for each case.

&gt;<i> Looking over the Coco documentation it looks that both regular
</I>&gt;<i> coroutines and Coco C coroutines can be mixed so perhaps it becomes a
</I>&gt;<i> matter of using the new Coco capabilities judiciously on coroutines  
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> really need the capability.
</I>
I'm not sure what the deal is there.  Perhaps there's some stack  
imparted by Lua that's increasing the amount of space needed?

I'll email Mike Pall, who wrote the Coco patch, about some of these  
issues sometime this week, and see if he has any suggestions/comments.

I'm sorry to hear that.  I hope all goes well.
