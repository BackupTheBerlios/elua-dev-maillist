</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> You're not off track at all.  I'm not yet familiar enough with Lua to

</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> registers two pieces of code for each event handler within the  
</I>&gt;<i> application.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The first piece is a Lua/C function that defines a condition for  
</I>&gt;<i> when an
</I>&gt;<i> event should be handled.  Examples of event conditions could be a  
</I>&gt;<i> button
</I>&gt;<i> press, the distance sensor indicating an object at a specific  
</I>&gt;<i> distance,
</I>&gt;<i> the light sensor detecting light or dark, a timer going off, a  
</I>&gt;<i> packet of
</I>&gt;<i> data received over the USB port or virtual events generated from other
</I>&gt;<i> pieces of code.  Certain conditions can be handled entirely within C
</I>&gt;<i> such as system level events and timers while other will need the
</I>&gt;<i> snippets of Lua code to handle more complex conditions such those
</I>&gt;<i> involving math expressions being processed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The second piece is the the actual event handler which is really  
</I>&gt;<i> just a
</I>&gt;<i> coroutine within Lua.  Once a condition for an event is detected (i.e.
</I>&gt;<i> the code above returns non-nil) the scheduler then schedules the
</I>&gt;<i> co-routine to run.  I'll make provisions so that loops created within
</I>&gt;<i> the code will yield appropriately so as not to drown out all other  
</I>&gt;<i> event
</I>&gt;<i> handling if a long loop is created.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The scheduler is in a loop waiting for event handling code to yield  
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> then serially checking the conditions to see if other event handlers  
</I>&gt;<i> are
</I>&gt;<i> ready to be resumed.
</I>
I see you've thought this through :-)  I think this would be excellent  
to have as a general facility that's easy to hook into.  In recent  
weeks I've been trying to think about how to couple things like the  
analog conversions with coroutines to make things more efficient than  
just constantly polling from the lua side.

I think, also, that Bogdan may be right about it being not hugely  
painful to get Coco working.  While it can use POSIX facilities for  
context switching, it looks like there are a number of other ways to  
do that including inline assembler and setjmp, so that may be fairly  
doable too.

&gt;<i> My ultimate goal is to create a children's programming IDE for Lego
</I>&gt;<i> robotics (and other robots) that is very much inspired by Scratch  
</I>&gt;<i> which
</I>&gt;<i> is created by the Life Long Kindergarten group at MIT.  Kids  
</I>&gt;<i> graphically
</I>&gt;<i> assemble their programs in the IDE (so they are really never exposed
</I>&gt;<i> directly to the underlying Lua language) and then the IDE converts the
</I>&gt;<i> GUI elements to Lua algorithmically, compiles it to bytecode and then
</I>&gt;<i> downloads the code to the robot for execution.  I'm fairly certain  
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> with some care and imagination, I can create something much more
</I>&gt;<i> friendly for kids than Lego's own NXT-G environment.  To achieve  
</I>&gt;<i> this I
</I>&gt;<i> need a bytecode interpreter running on the NXT and so far Lua seems to
</I>&gt;<i> fit the bill nicely.  My alternative is Java bytecode which seems
</I>&gt;<i> bloated compared to my experience so far with the lightness of Lua.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My challenge is preserving Scratch-like programming semantics as  
</I>&gt;<i> much as
</I>&gt;<i> possible (i.e. keeping it highly event driven) yet still produce code
</I>&gt;<i> that will execute well on a very low power Arm processor.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Because the kids aren't programming directly in Lua I'll have control
</I>&gt;<i> over the resulting code such as making sure that looping constructs
</I>&gt;<i> appropriately call yield operations to allow other code to run.  Some
</I>&gt;<i> aspects of this might be a challenge, but I have a feeling Lua's
</I>&gt;<i> cooperative threading will be MUCH easier to deal with than if I had
</I>&gt;<i> actual preemptive threads to deal with.
</I>
They certainly have downsides, but it does, by default, steer one away  
from a lot of potential issues with making things thread-safe.

It would be somewhat nice to have green threads in Lua, although I  
guess you can sort of do that with Coco or with the debug hooks.

Here are a few interesting discussions that are related:

</I>&gt;<i> As much fun as I'm having with embedded Lua, it's really just a  
</I>&gt;<i> piece of
</I>&gt;<i> the overall application I'm hoping to create.
</I>
Very neat project.  I don't have any NXT devices, but I'll be  
interested in watching where this goes.

It should also give us some interesting information about how eLua  
works for these usage styles :-)
