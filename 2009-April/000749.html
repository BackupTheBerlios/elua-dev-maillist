<PRE>In getting developer SVN access the eLua, Bogdan and I wanted to move a 
portion of our discussion to the developer list.  Portions of the thread 
are copied below for reference.

</I>&gt;<i> - embedded flash controller and file system: generally speaking, we like

</I>&gt;<i> file system first. Ideally we'll separate the generic parts from the 
</I>&gt;<i> platform-specific parts, thus making it really portable.
</I>
The code is split into two parts -- the top level file system code is 
fairly generic and the bottom level code in a separate file which deals 
directly with the AT91 embedded flash controller.  The code is really 
green (just written a few days ago) so there is no urgent need to get it 
in or anything.  I'll post a link to the files where others can examine 
them (and make suggestions).  Over time, if others think the file system 
would be useful it can be integrated in a way that makes it fairly 
portable between platforms that may implement embedded nand flash memory 
in different ways.

&gt;<i> - USB drivers? what for? I mean, I know what they are :), but do you 
</I>&gt;<i> have a specific usage scenario for USB+eLua ?
</I>
With regards to USB, I think it's useful for the AT91 chips in that the 
dev boards for those chips are commonly plugged into the PC via the USB 
port.  Serial ports are harder to come by on PCs these days and almost 
non-existent on laptops (OK, USB to serial cables aren't too hard to 
find).  I believe enabling a build switch to make the eLua shell console 
active through the USB port rather than the serial port is indeed 
useful.  I would suggest making USB shell access a compile time switch 
that can be set for those platforms which support a USB controller.  It 
should be easy to make portable in that from eLua perspective it looks 
pretty much just like a serial port -- only the underlying driver kept 
in the platform specific code is much different.

&gt;<i> - zmodem: nice to have, but I see it happening only on platforms with 
</I>&gt;<i> LOTS of RAM, as it is not at all a resource-friendly protocol (talking 
</I>&gt;<i> from an embedded programmer's point of view).
</I>
For zmodem, the implementation I ported from the AVRFreaks site was 
intended for the AVR ATmega128 (16k SRAM) and uses very little RAM -- 
less than the current eLua xmodem code in fact.  It does a good job of 
implementing the protocol byte-by-byte rather than buffering entire 
frames.  That said, zmodem doesn't offer much over xmodem for the way 
eLua is using it.  I needed it for bulk transfer of files to the file 
system on the chip.

These are just things that I need for my specific use and I would be 
happy to make any pieces available to others who would find them useful 
as well.
