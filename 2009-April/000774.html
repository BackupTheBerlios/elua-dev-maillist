<PRE>&gt;<i> James,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would definitely be interested in taking a look at your branch.  If it
</I>&gt;<i> can be made to work well, it may impact the direction I take with the
</I>&gt;<i> project I'm working on.  However, it does seem that specifying a 1K
</I>&gt;<i> stack for each C coroutine imposes a fairly heavy price in a limited RAM
</I>&gt;<i> environment for the features that Coco offers.
</I>

For sure, but I don't know if you can do better than this.


&gt;<i> Looking over the Coco documentation it looks that both regular
</I>&gt;<i> coroutines and Coco C coroutines can be mixed so perhaps it becomes a
</I>&gt;<i> matter of using the new Coco capabilities judiciously on coroutines that
</I>&gt;<i> really need the capability.
</I>

&quot;Judiciously&quot; is the right word, indeed. Overusing Coco is generally not a
big deal on desktops, but might be quite different on embedded. Personally I
never had to use Coco, but I'm not the best to judge here, as I use Lua
rarely on desktops.
Unfortunately, mixing Lua coroutines and Coco coroutines might lead to
problems, since after you apply Coco all the coroutines are created WITH a C
stack, you need to give special arguments to coroutine.create if you want a
regular coroutine. I'd rather have it the other way around to preserve
compatibility with old code.


&gt;<i> Unfortunately, a family emergency will be taking up a lot of my time
</I>&gt;<i> over the next few weeks so it may take me a while to get back with
</I>&gt;<i> comments on your work once a new branch is created.
</I>

Sorry to hear that, hope it will end soon and good :)
And thanks both for pushing Coco into eLua, it might appeal to some people.
We can put it into trunk if we make it configurable at compile time.

Best,
Bogdan
