To make this discussion a little less theoretical, the code for my eLua 
file system for embedded flash controller and NAND flash on the AT91 Arm 
chips is included in the link below:

<A HREF="http://home.comcast.net/~michael.p.thompson/elua/elua_efcfs.zip">http://home.comcast.net/~michael.p.thompson/elua/elua_efcfs.zip</A>

This is something I wrote out of necessity fairly quickly after reading 
about how other NAND file systems such as YAFFs work at a theoretical 
level.  The top level portion in the file 'efcfs.c' implements the file 
system and calls the five functions in the lower level file 'efcio.c' 
which in turn use the efc/flashd library calls provided by Atmel for the 
AT91 Arm MCUs (that code is not included in the zip file above).

In a nutshell, the driver works as follows.  It uses the existing linker 
symbols _efixed, _erelocate and _srelocate to determine the unused 
portion of on-board flash memory.  These pages should be initialized to 
all 0xFF -- something I do by adding the '--pad-to 0x00140000 --gap-fill 
0xff' options to the arm-elf-objcopy command that creates the final 
binary from the elf image.  For each 256 byte flash page I reserve 12 
bytes for page usage including the page sequence, file id, file block 
and file block size information -- 244 bytes for file data.  Writes to a 
file handle are buffered in SRAM until the block needs to be flushed to 
a page in flash.  Algorithms then kick in make sure that the write 
occurs in a round robin fashion to the underlying pages in flash memory 
so pages get used evenly.

One aspect of this file system is that it currently exercises flash wear 
leveling to the dynamic (unused) portion of the file system only -- not 
to the static portion of the file system.  This means that if a file 
consumes 50% of the file system only the pages in the other 50% of file 
system be recycled in a round robin manner as other files are written 
and deleted.  Changing things so that both the static and dynamic parts 
of the file system are wear leveled at the cost of some additional I/O 
shouldn't be hard, but I just haven't done it yet.

Also, unlike other NAND file systems such as YAFFS, this file system 
consumes very little SRAM overhead other than the required page buffers. 
  Instead of keeping file system booking structures in SRAM my functions 
simply scan the addressed NAND to determine the next free page to write 
and such.  This doesn't make it fast, but with the limited flash on most 
Arm processors making only a few hundred pages (128K to 256K typically) 
at most available to the file system it seems plenty fast enough. 
Finally, the file system only supports a root level directory and 
filenames are limited to 32 characters with null termination (this can 
be changed easily in a #define).

I'm not familiar with how flash works on non-AT91SAM7 Arm processors, 
but hopefully just changes to 'efcio.c' would be needed to support other 
families of Arm processors with on-board flash.  External NAND chips 
could possibly be supported, but that is beyond the scope of the 
intentions for this simple file system.  In that case, YAFFs would be 
much more suited as it covers error correction and will work with the 
out-of-band data on each flash page.

This code is pretty green right now and I would love to have feedback on 
improvements that could be made.
