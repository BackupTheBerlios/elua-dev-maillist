You're not off track at all.  I'm not yet familiar enough with Lua to 
understand what exactly is practical, but my thinking is creating a 
central scheduler/dispatcher written in C for efficiency and compactness 
of implementation.  I'll then have a Lua component that initializes and 
registers two pieces of code for each event handler within the application.

The first piece is a Lua/C function that defines a condition for when an 
event should be handled.  Examples of event conditions could be a button 
press, the distance sensor indicating an object at a specific distance, 
the light sensor detecting light or dark, a timer going off, a packet of 
data received over the USB port or virtual events generated from other 
pieces of code.  Certain conditions can be handled entirely within C 
such as system level events and timers while other will need the 
snippets of Lua code to handle more complex conditions such those 
involving math expressions being processed.

The second piece is the the actual event handler which is really just a 
coroutine within Lua.  Once a condition for an event is detected (i.e. 
the code above returns non-nil) the scheduler then schedules the 
co-routine to run.  I'll make provisions so that loops created within 
the code will yield appropriately so as not to drown out all other event 
handling if a long loop is created.

The scheduler is in a loop waiting for event handling code to yield and 
then serially checking the conditions to see if other event handlers are 
ready to be resumed.

My ultimate goal is to create a children's programming IDE for Lego 
robotics (and other robots) that is very much inspired by Scratch which 
is created by the Life Long Kindergarten group at MIT.  Kids graphically 
assemble their programs in the IDE (so they are really never exposed 
directly to the underlying Lua language) and then the IDE converts the 
GUI elements to Lua algorithmically, compiles it to bytecode and then 
downloads the code to the robot for execution.  I'm fairly certain that 
with some care and imagination, I can create something much more 
friendly for kids than Lego's own NXT-G environment.  To achieve this I 
need a bytecode interpreter running on the NXT and so far Lua seems to 
fit the bill nicely.  My alternative is Java bytecode which seems 
bloated compared to my experience so far with the lightness of Lua.

My challenge is preserving Scratch-like programming semantics as much as 
possible (i.e. keeping it highly event driven) yet still produce code 
that will execute well on a very low power Arm processor.

Because the kids aren't programming directly in Lua I'll have control 
over the resulting code such as making sure that looping constructs 
appropriately call yield operations to allow other code to run.  Some 
aspects of this might be a challenge, but I have a feeling Lua's 
cooperative threading will be MUCH easier to deal with than if I had 
actual preemptive threads to deal with.

As much fun as I'm having with embedded Lua, it's really just a piece of 
the overall application I'm hoping to create.

Mike
