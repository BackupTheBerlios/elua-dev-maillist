Just a follow up on this, I did take Bogdan's warning to heart about 
using the FAT file system over raw NAND flash.  After scouring the 
Internet with Google and not finding anything suitable (small, free and 
easy to use) I've put together my own simple linear file store system 
for the AT91SAM7 EFC.  It should correctly implement a wear leveling 
strategy whereby it keeps track of the order of writes to the underlying 
flash to distribute them evenly across all blocks in the filestore -- 
even when rewriting portions of an existing file.

Because there is no central table at the top of the filesystem it won't 
win any speed contests as all searches for file blocks are linear across 
the filestore.  I took this approach to minimize bookkeeping structures 
in SRAM which other linear file stores will typically use.  This 
strategy should work fine for small file systems on the order of a few 
hundred flash pages.

It's very simple and just supports a root directory with an arbitrary 
number of files, but it should get the job done.  It will intergrate 
with eLua as a filesystem connected via newlib just as FatFs does so the 
usual open, close, read, write, etc. calls should work.

I want to spend a few days cleaning up code and performing unit testing, 
but I'll be happy to share it with others who may find it useful.  I'm 
sure a few other sets of eyes looking it over would help with ideas for 
making it more portable and more efficient.

I'll be using this to store Lua byte code and other resources on the 
internal flash of the AT91SAM7S of the NXT Lego brick.  I wanted 
something well integrated with the file system, but reasonable for the 
raw NAND flash.
