Hmmm, I haven't thought of making it a general purpose facility.  I'll 
need to think about that more as it would help evolve anything put 
together better than me working on my lonesome.

I only spent about 5 minutes looking at Coco so far, but it appeared to 
me that it depended on OS features for implementation.  Not sure how 
easy that would be to replicate in the raw eLua environment.  Based on 
the Bogdan's comments I'll plan to spend more time looking into how Coco 
works to see what is really involved.  It's ported to a number of 
environments so hopefully there is already enough of a bread trail to 
understand what the effort would be.

The JIT would be cool to :-), but not if it increases the ROM footprint.

&gt;<i> Here are a few interesting discussions that are related:

Thanks for the links.  I'll read through these over the weekend.
