The way the patch is originally set up each new coroutine gets 60k of  
stack space, which, obviously was way WAY too much for eLua.  I'd  
somewhat like to inspect what really is on the stack that needs to be  
preserved when you create a coroutine from Lua, but I haven't  
investigated yet.  Bogdan do you have a sense for this?

I also haven't done the next obvious thing and see how many coroutines  
I can create in stock eLua, so I have no idea whether the 1k overhead  
is really ridiculous or comparable.  I'll do some experiments today.   
I'm TA'ing a lab where the students are using NXT bricks to make a  
tensile testing machine for biomaterials :-)  (unfortunately they're  
using MATLAB, but I'll certainly mention pbLua and eLua to the profs  
for future reference).

&gt;<i> Unfortunately, mixing Lua coroutines and Coco coroutines might lead  
</I>&gt;<i> to problems, since after you apply Coco all the coroutines are

</I>&gt;<i> the other way around to preserve compatibility with old code.
</I>
I'm pretty sure we could reverse that behavior at the cost of making  
it behave differently than the regular coco patch.  That might make a  
good way to have it be reasonable to turn coco on by default (when  
platform support is properly set up).

</I>&gt;<i> Sorry to hear that, hope it will end soon and good :)
</I>&gt;<i> And thanks both for pushing Coco into eLua, it might appeal to some  
</I>&gt;<i> people. We can put it into trunk if we make it configurable at  
</I>&gt;<i> compile time.
</I>
Luckily it's a non-destructive patch.  You can restore default  
behavior with a define that disables coco.  I would suggest that if it  
gets merged that we make disabled the default state, and then it can  
be selectively enabled where desired.  If it turns out we can make the  
overhead really minimal, maybe they can be on by default at some point.
