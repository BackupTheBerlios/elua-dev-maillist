<PRE>That would be great. I also have quite a hectic schedule for approximately the next 2 weeks and then I will be free. Being your own boss can kill you sometimes.

I have all the PDF files for the PLC - where can I deposit them? If people are happy with what they see then I will upload all the Gerber files a bit later. All I need is a bit of guidance here on where to deposit the files without creating confusion. I guess a bit of moderator support is required at this junction.

Quentin.

I would be interested and willing to help you get eLua running on your PLC board. I am unlikely to have much time for the next two weeks due to a work project deliverable. After that I could spend some time on getting eLua running and working on some modules to interface to the various hardware peripherals.


I also may be interested in your Ethernet gateway board, as I have a few projects where I plan on using eLua and will need Ethernet.

Hello All

If I was to design an Ethernet to serial gateway would there be any interest? Basically it would accept 10/100 Mb Ethernet and convert it to serial or SPI and vica-versa.

I would make all the gerber files available. I think that a modular method is perhaps the best route to follow as main processor is then not burdened with these other tasks. All it has to do is to capture packets on the Serial or SPI layer, process them and reply if necessary.

I also have a complete design for a small PLC using the STR912FAW47. It has:

2 x 12 bit D/A converters on it, the outputs filtered and buffered 0- 5V,
4 x 12 bit A/D channels
2 x I2C channels for user expansion
512K x 16 Static RAM
32K x 8 FRAM or more depending on which IC you select
1 x RS232 channel
1 x RS485 channel
1 x SPI port for user expansion
1 x SIM900 GSM module
4 x Optically isolated interrupt coupled digital inputs
4 x Relay outputs
1 x USB port
1 x Onboard PSU which generates all the required voltage rails.

Most of the low level drivers are written in C and have been battled tested. This is revision 2 of the board, so there are a few hardware changes and some of the drivers have to change, or still have to be written. Everything is interrupt driven.


I have not yet had the time to implement eLua on it, but there is a port available for this CPU.
Is anyone interested in working with me to get this up and going with eLua?
