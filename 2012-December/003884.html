<PRE>Hello list,
   (and I'm very pleased to be able to say it again, after over a year of
health issues, that are becoming history now)
   Sorry for the absence, thanks for the patience and the confidence with
the project.
   Yes, there are repos' and some more serious issues, that we really plan
to attack now, with the help of you all. Bj&#246;rn message sounds like a good
place to start, I have a bunch of other notes to put some priorities with
all the community and we also (finally) have a draft of a roadmap to
present soon too.
   Some comments on Bj&#246;rn's message below...

Thanksssss


&gt;<i> I tried elua some month ago when the mbed was first supported, now i am

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Nice. I'm sure you're not alone in your choices.


&gt;<i> But - i am a little bit confused about the different source trees which
</I>&gt;<i> have been forked and which are around.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As i have understood correctly, the &quot;important&quot; git repos are:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Main elua git: <A HREF="git://github.com/elua/elua.git">git://github.com/elua/elua.git</A>
</I>

Yes, this is the one and only &quot;official&quot; repo of the project, if the git
model allow us to call it this way.
Accepted pull requests will always be merged to this repo, be it on master
or on some other branch for some reason.


&gt;<i> omnima stm32expander git fork: <A HREF="git://github.com/omnima/elua.**git&lt;http://github.com/omnima/elua.git">git://github.com/omnima/elua.**git&lt;http://github.com/omnima/elua.git</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> elua dev?: <A HREF="git://github.com/jsnyder/elua.**git&lt;http://github.com/jsnyder/elua.git">git://github.com/jsnyder/elua.**git&lt;http://github.com/jsnyder/elua.git</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> stm32 f1/f2/f4 fork: <A HREF="git://github.com/jsnyder/elua.**git&lt;http://github.com/jsnyder/elua.git">git://github.com/jsnyder/elua.**git&lt;http://github.com/jsnyder/elua.git</A>&gt;(bikeNomad-master)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Reading <A HREF="https://github.com/elua/elua/**network&lt;https://github.com/elua/elua/network">https://github.com/elua/elua/**network&lt;https://github.com/elua/elua/network</A>&gt;and the blog it seems that
</I>&gt;<i> - bikeNomad master (stm32f4) was merged into the jsnyder
</I>&gt;<i> git/bikeNomad-master
</I>&gt;<i> - omnima stm32expander seems to be just old and is not in sync with master
</I>&gt;<i> and doesn't seem to be merged with the master (?)
</I>&gt;<i> - jsnyder seems to be the most active git repository (?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
James Snyder has been one of the greatest contributors to the project since
the start of it. We actually consider him as almost an Author now and this
should/will be reflected on our doc too.
A lot of work has been done this year but not always in a well coordinated
way. This led to James, Bogdan, SimpleMachines' guys, just to mention a
few, to end up working on repos of their choices.
We should go back ASAP to the Pull Request model that git suggests and
merge all these efforts to master.


&gt;<i> Does that mean that i have to pull all trees and merge and patch them
</I>&gt;<i> manually in the future?
</I>

No, this should not be a burden task for the user community.


&gt;<i> Are changes from jsnyder updated in the main elua repo or are they
</I>&gt;<i> different repos/branches?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
They are slowly being merged to the pre0.9 branch on  <A HREF="git://">git://</A>
github.com/elua/elua.git and this will become master when we release v0.9

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am just a little bit confused and hope someone can give me a cleaner
</I>&gt;<i> view of the situation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Not your fault, this is my bad, thank you for the heads up and for raising
this. I hope you and all the community can continue to contribute cause
we're committed to correct these issues.

This should not happen again in the future as one of the roadmap's plans is
to (finally) adopt a &quot;release soon release often&quot; model, where there will
be much less changes between the versions. The work for the v0.9 has
already begun but unfortunately, due to the issues you've raised, we have a
lot of work to merge, test, document and release it.


&gt;<i> Bye and thanks
</I>&gt;<i> Bj&#246;rn Kalkbrenner
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Thank you
And again, thank you all for the support!!!
