Like most of these things, three weeks' sweat following dozens of
things that it wasn't.. and in the end the change was to just move one
line of code down by four lines.

Thanks for the extra info.

Even the most recent newlib (with the bug fixed) only uses dlmalloc
2.6.5 from 2007, whereas eLua has 2.8.3 (most recent is 2.8.5).  I
think the reason for them sticking to that is that dlmalloc has
doubled in size over the years. Code sizes are:
simple    832 bytes + 1 bss (!)
newlib   2312 + 1040 data + 52 bss
multiple 7092 + 480 data

They all seem too handle multiple memory spaces OK in eLua.

In the tests i've run, the overall speed difference has been
negligable between the different dlmallocs:
simple: 22.0 seconds
newlib: 13.5 seconds
multiple: 13.5 seconds

But yes, avoiding newlib's malloc might be a good default strategy, in
case anyone is using a toolchain with newlib&lt;1.19.0

incidentally, there is also the more recent TLSF allocator, which is
guaranteed to run in constant time for every malloc and each free(),
however much/little/fragmented RAM you are using, as well as having
the usual good fragmentation, overhead and code size properties.
Furthermore, instead of blindly calling sbrk() for &quot;More!&quot; when it
runs out of memory, as the other three do, you pass it the available
memory regions at program startup and it uses those.  For our
platforms, which have a fixed amount of RAM that is known in advance,
that seems a more effective strategy.
It's a bit hard to find but someone is conserving v2.0 at
<A HREF="http://tlsf.baisoku.org/">http://tlsf.baisoku.org/</A> which has compiled code size of 5k and no
data.

Though I've sometimes grumbled about having three memory allocators,
two build systems and so on, in finding this bug and noticing that it
only happened when using one of them was the key to finding it.

Thanks again for your suggestions along the way, which certainly helped
