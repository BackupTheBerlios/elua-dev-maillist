This kind of thing tends to happen a lot to me. And it's extremely frustrating.

</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for the extra info.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Even the most recent newlib (with the bug fixed) only uses dlmalloc

</I>&gt;<i> newlib &#160; 2312 + 1040 data + 52 bss
</I>&gt;<i> multiple 7092 + 480 data
</I>
I think I tried older versions of dlmalloc too and dismissed them
because of some missing features. Can't remember the details though,
this happened a few years ago.

</I>&gt;<i> But yes, avoiding newlib's malloc might be a good default strategy, in

I tried to integrate TLSF quite a while ago and couldn't make it to
work for the life of me. I got so frustrated that I gave up entirely.
In any case, it does have a penalty: it has a two level zone size
directory, as opposed to dl which keeps of all its zone sizes on a
single level, thus wasting precious RAM (while increasing speed, of
course). If you want to give it a spin, be my guest :)

&gt;<i> guaranteed to run in constant time for every malloc and each free(),
</I>&gt;<i> however much/little/fragmented RAM you are using, as well as having
</I>&gt;<i> the usual good fragmentation, overhead and code size properties.
</I>&gt;<i> Furthermore, instead of blindly calling sbrk() for &quot;More!&quot; when it
</I>&gt;<i> runs out of memory, as the other three do, you pass it the available
</I>&gt;<i> memory regions at program startup and it uses those. &#160;For our
</I>&gt;<i> platforms, which have a fixed amount of RAM that is known in advance,
</I>&gt;<i> that seems a more effective strategy.
</I>&gt;<i> It's a bit hard to find but someone is conserving v2.0 at

</I>&gt;<i> data.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Though I've sometimes grumbled about having three memory allocators,
</I>&gt;<i> two build systems and so on, in finding this bug and noticing that it
</I>&gt;<i> only happened when using one of them was the key to finding it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks again for your suggestions along the way, which certainly helped

Thanks again for being patient enough to track this bastard :)

Best,
