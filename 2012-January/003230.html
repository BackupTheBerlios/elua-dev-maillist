<PRE>Hi Patrick
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hi Niccio
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've only been able to spend 10 or 15 minutes with Goat(having crazy 
</I>&gt;<i> day) but already 95% of it is obvious. It is a painless transition 
</I>&gt;<i> from Scite but adds stuff the elua community needs..
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are a few things I never really figured out or had time to play 
</I>&gt;<i> with in Scite. One was syntax highlighting. At night it's nice to have 
</I>&gt;<i> a dark background and the other was compile.
</I>It is a very good software...

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> WebBuilder looks really neat and it's totally straightforward but I am 
</I>&gt;<i> guessing that for a full time embedded programmer, they would want the 
</I>&gt;<i> tool chain on the local machine. Is it possible to cross compile with 
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;compile&quot; feature? Will Scite tutorials be valid for this? I would 
</I>&gt;<i> like to study more about this.
</I>
It might be feasible in the future

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just an idea.... but once I work through James's tutorials I would 
</I>&gt;<i> like to flash my board with jtag on linux. It might be nice to be able 
</I>&gt;<i> to integrate openOCD features into Goat.
</I>I'd also like me to do so in the future.... why not?
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Once I learn more about Goat I would love to do some screencasts about 
</I>&gt;<i> it. The first two tutorials seemed to go over well with people but I 
</I>&gt;<i> am going to redo them. I bought a nice microphone(Blue Yeti) and am 
</I>&gt;<i> learning more about Audacity/Pitivi. I hope to do many screencasts 
</I>&gt;<i> this year, it would be great to use Goat as a central piece of these 
</I>&gt;<i> tutorials.
</I>great, I'm not the right person for the job,
I did it in a hurry it is  my first experience with youtube... :-/

Nuccio

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks again for all your hard work-Patrick
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

</PRE>
