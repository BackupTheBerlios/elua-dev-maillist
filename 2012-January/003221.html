</I>&gt;<i> Hi Patrick,
</I>&gt;<i> I'm very happy about  this.

</I>Hi Niccio

I've only been able to spend 10 or 15 minutes with Goat(having crazy 
day) but already 95% of it is obvious. It is a painless transition from 
Scite but adds stuff the elua community needs..

There are a few things I never really figured out or had time to play 
with in Scite. One was syntax highlighting. At night it's nice to have a 
dark background and the other was compile.

WebBuilder looks really neat and it's totally straightforward but I am 
guessing that for a full time embedded programmer, they would want the 
tool chain on the local machine. Is it possible to cross compile with 
the &quot;compile&quot; feature? Will Scite tutorials be valid for this? I would 
like to study more about this.

Just an idea.... but once I work through James's tutorials I would like 
to flash my board with jtag on linux. It might be nice to be able to 
integrate openOCD features into Goat.

Once I learn more about Goat I would love to do some screencasts about 
it. The first two tutorials seemed to go over well with people but I am 
going to redo them. I bought a nice microphone(Blue Yeti) and am 
learning more about Audacity/Pitivi. I hope to do many screencasts this 
year, it would be great to use Goat as a central piece of these tutorials.

Thanks again for all your hard work-Patrick
