</I>&gt;<i> 18 it does and it will even do both at once).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Thanks, I didn't know that. The only PIC with USB I ever played with was a
18F21550, and I was greatly disappointed by it (more specifically by its USB
implementation, which was extremely sensitive to electrical noise, even
after I designed and build a PCB around it). I do expect an improvement in
PIC32 though. I hope it can also do CDC out of the box (I'm sure it can, but
I'm hoping to find support in Microchip's library for CDC, as I really don't
feel like writing that), so we can get our serial port one way or another.
Strictly speaking, a serial port is not *required* for eLua, but it does
simplify the interaction with eLua quite a bit.

&gt;<i> Similar to the Mbed, would it not be possible to make the chip mount as a
</I>&gt;<i> disk drive on the host computer and edit the script files directly in place?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>You probably could (James Snyder is already working on this for Mbed), but
you'd still need a way to run the scripts. Currently, the only way to run
without an explicit command from the shell is to have an &quot;autorun.lua&quot; file
that is executed at startup. We'll think of new ways of interaction if
needed :)

&gt;<i> Ideally there could be a switch on the board and you&#8217;d flip it one way for
</I>&gt;<i> MSD to load your scripts and flip it the other way to run the scripts with
</I>&gt;<i> access to USB as HID so you could create USB devices.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I wouldn't go the HID way if I can do CDC. I don't see the point.

&gt;<i>   Time for another look, I think &#8211; Thanks Tony!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yeah, my thoughts exactly :)

Best,
Bogdan

</I>&gt;<i> 1. ST has expanded the STM32 Performance line with models with 96K SRAM and
</I>&gt;<i> 768K or 1024K flash; packages include a 64-pin QFP.  Not sure on
</I>&gt;<i> availability, but should be fairly soon.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Excellent. I really like the STM32s. If their next step is to bump the RAM
</I>&gt;<i> to 128k, I'll probably marry that chip (sorry, wife). 96k is good enough
</I>&gt;<i> though, I have a board with a STM32F103RE (512kF/32kR) and it can do a lot
</I>&gt;<i> of nice stuff.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Microchip has PIC32MX MCUs with 128K SRAM and 512K flash in a QFP-64.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> WOW! Now this is something I really have to try soon. I have an older PIC32
</I>&gt;<i> board at home, but accessing its UART requires a connector that is hard to
</I>&gt;<i> find and even harder to solder, so I didn't touch it yet (although PIC32 has
</I>&gt;<i> been on eLua's TOPORT list for quite a while now). This is one thing about
</I>&gt;<i> Microchip's PIC32 boards that annoys me quite a bit: in order to have a
</I>&gt;<i> proper development environment for eLua (an UART, to be more precise), I'd
</I>&gt;<i> have to buy the PIC32 board (
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&amp;nodeId=2615&amp;dDocName=en535536">http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&amp;nodeId=2615&amp;dDocName=en535536</A>)
</I>&gt;<i> which should be then stuck in a PIC32 I/O expansion board (
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&amp;nodeId=2615&amp;dDocName=en535444">http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&amp;nodeId=2615&amp;dDocName=en535444</A>)
</I>&gt;<i> and I still have to use some sort of daugherboard in that one to get a
</I>&gt;<i> serial connector (if I don't feel like soldering, that is).
</I>&gt;<i> That said, I have to check if I can't use one of the on-board USB
</I>&gt;<i> connections as a CDC, this might simplify things quite a bit. I don't think
</I>&gt;<i> I have the time to develop a CDC device on PIC32 myself, but maybe they have
</I>&gt;<i> something like this in their software library. And who knows, maybe they're
</I>&gt;<i> even willing to sponsor us. Thanks for the hint! I had no idea about this
</I>&gt;<i> new line (new to me, as least :) ) of PIC32 devices.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. If you want to go for broke, Renesas has the SH7216 series with 200MHz
</I>&gt;<i> speed, FPU, 128K SRAM and 1024K flash -- but as usual with Renesas,
</I>&gt;<i> availability is poor and the price is high (Digikey only lists one model,
</I>&gt;<i> not in stock, for $42.27 qty 1).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If they're not easily available in the US, chances are they aren't
</I>&gt;<i> available at all in Europe. I found it quite hard to find Renesas products
</I>&gt;<i> in Europe. Still, this chip sounds SWEET. Especially the FPU part.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Someday Renesas promises they'll have a new RX600 MCU with 256K SRAM and
</I>&gt;<i> 4M flash.  On the good side, Renesas does make a lot of very capable MCUs in
</I>&gt;<i> QFPs.  But, I'm not holding my breath waiting for availability (my guess is
</I>&gt;<i> it's at least several years away).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You're probably right, but it's very good to see this &quot;more on-board RAM
</I>&gt;<i> and Flash&quot; trend. Very nice for eLua, as we all know :)

</I>&gt;<i>   When I subscribed to this list half a year ago I confidently expected to

</I>&gt;<i> use many such chips in a seriously distributed architecture with the
</I>&gt;<i> processing kept near to the IO to simplify wiring. To avoid buying an
</I>&gt;<i> endless succession of development boards I set a simple threshold
</I>&gt;<i> specification of 512K on-chip flash, 64K on-chip RAM, Ethernet capability (I
</I>&gt;<i> was prepared to compromise with a second chip for this). With this type of
</I>&gt;<i> distributed architecture, I need lots of IO versatility (analog, PWM, UART,
</I>&gt;<i> I2C, SPI, counters etc.) but multiplexed on relatively few pins since if you
</I>&gt;<i> run out of IO you just add another chip. It should therefore be possible to
</I>&gt;<i> have a simple 20-40 pin package which could be available in hand-solderable
</I>&gt;<i> form.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is very disappointing that after many months still the only chip that
</I>&gt;<i> comes near is the LPC2888 which seems to be buggy and expensive (the very
</I>&gt;<i> minimalist LPC-H2888 prototype board is over $150). Looking at the
</I>&gt;<i> schematics for this board really reinforced my intuition about the
</I>&gt;<i> importance of on-chip memory &#8211; a ridiculous number of pins (and therefore
</I>&gt;<i> PCB traces) is wasted on the external memory interface. And the economics
</I>&gt;<i> are terrible - for just $20 more, you can get the new Acer Aspire Revo R3600
</I>&gt;<i> nettop (in Linux rather than Vista trim). The latter has both wired and
</I>&gt;<i> wireless networking, 1GB RAM and an 8GB SSD!

</I>&gt;<i> IO is the problem of course with an X86 platform. However in my research I
</I>&gt;<i> found this incredibly poorly marketed chip:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A versatile USB to IO pins chip for only $8! This looks like great
</I>&gt;<i> universal IO problem solver. Unlike most other DIY USB solutions I&#8217;ve seen
</I>&gt;<i> which require a driver and/or serial port emulator, this is HID based and
</I>&gt;<i> therefore driverless on all major OS&#8217;s. I have ordered some of these chips
</I>&gt;<i> and will report back how it goes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am beginning to think it might just be better to cooperate with market

</I>&gt;<i> to produce a custom cut-down Linux distro with Lua built in (and perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> acting as the shell)?
