<PRE>I'm glad to be the catalyst for a PIC32 port; I do think the PIC32MX795F512H
looks pretty interesting.  I was very surprised that Microchip included so
much RAM, because in the past PIC micros have been pretty light on RAM.

It looks like the PIC32MX795F512's are just starting to reach the
distributors (e.g. Mouser USA has 10 in stock).

Another bit of news: Atmel is working on a single precision FPU for the
AVR32 U3 series.  Since no parts were announced, it'll be a while (my guess:
&gt;<i>2 years to reach distribution).  But a AVR32U3 series with &gt;= 128K SRAM and
</I>FPU would be pretty sweet.

</I>&gt;<i> Even more single-chip eLua candidates are coming, so the situation is a bit
</I>&gt;<i> better than last year.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. ST has expanded the STM32 Performance line with models with 96K SRAM and
</I>&gt;<i> 768K or 1024K flash; packages include a 64-pin QFP.  Not sure on
</I>&gt;<i> availability, but should be fairly soon.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Excellent. I really like the STM32s. If their next step is to bump the RAM
</I>&gt;<i> to 128k, I'll probably marry that chip (sorry, wife). 96k is good enough
</I>&gt;<i> though, I have a board with a STM32F103RE (512kF/32kR) and it can do a lot
</I>&gt;<i> of nice stuff.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Microchip has PIC32MX MCUs with 128K SRAM and 512K flash in a QFP-64.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> WOW! Now this is something I really have to try soon. I have an older PIC32
</I>&gt;<i> board at home, but accessing its UART requires a connector that is hard to
</I>&gt;<i> find and even harder to solder, so I didn't touch it yet (although PIC32 has
</I>&gt;<i> been on eLua's TOPORT list for quite a while now). This is one thing about
</I>&gt;<i> Microchip's PIC32 boards that annoys me quite a bit: in order to have a
</I>&gt;<i> proper development environment for eLua (an UART, to be more precise), I'd
</I>&gt;<i> have to buy the PIC32 board (
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&amp;nodeId=2615&amp;dDocName=en535536">http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&amp;nodeId=2615&amp;dDocName=en535536</A>)
</I>&gt;<i> which should be then stuck in a PIC32 I/O expansion board (
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&amp;nodeId=2615&amp;dDocName=en535444">http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&amp;nodeId=2615&amp;dDocName=en535444</A>)
</I>&gt;<i> and I still have to use some sort of daugherboard in that one to get a
</I>&gt;<i> serial connector (if I don't feel like soldering, that is).
</I>&gt;<i> That said, I have to check if I can't use one of the on-board USB
</I>&gt;<i> connections as a CDC, this might simplify things quite a bit. I don't think
</I>&gt;<i> I have the time to develop a CDC device on PIC32 myself, but maybe they have
</I>&gt;<i> something like this in their software library. And who knows, maybe they're
</I>&gt;<i> even willing to sponsor us. Thanks for the hint! I had no idea about this
</I>&gt;<i> new line (new to me, as least :) ) of PIC32 devices.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. If you want to go for broke, Renesas has the SH7216 series with 200MHz
</I>&gt;<i> speed, FPU, 128K SRAM and 1024K flash -- but as usual with Renesas,
</I>&gt;<i> availability is poor and the price is high (Digikey only lists one model,
</I>&gt;<i> not in stock, for $42.27 qty 1).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If they're not easily available in the US, chances are they aren't
</I>&gt;<i> available at all in Europe. I found it quite hard to find Renesas products
</I>&gt;<i> in Europe. Still, this chip sounds SWEET. Especially the FPU part.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Someday Renesas promises they'll have a new RX600 MCU with 256K SRAM and
</I>&gt;<i> 4M flash.  On the good side, Renesas does make a lot of very capable MCUs in
</I>&gt;<i> QFPs.  But, I'm not holding my breath waiting for availability (my guess is
</I>&gt;<i> it's at least several years away).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You're probably right, but it's very good to see this &quot;more on-board RAM
</I>&gt;<i> and Flash&quot; trend. Very nice for eLua, as we all know :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best,
</I>&gt;<i> Bogdan
