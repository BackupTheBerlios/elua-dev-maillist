<PRE>&gt;<i> Hi Everyone
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Hi!


&gt;<i> In order to use eLua properly I am trying to learn more about
</I>&gt;<i> microcontrollers in general. I know AVR ones can be programmed in C but many
</I>&gt;<i> others require assembly. Would I be better off struggling through with
</I>&gt;<i> assembly to gain an intimate knowledge a device or better off with something
</I>&gt;<i> a little higher up like C?
</I>

You'll definitely be better off with assembly if you want to know your
device intimately. Question is, do you really need it? Most of the time I
find out that I don't. Especially for 32-bit CPUs, the trend between
manufacturers is to provide extremely complete support libraries that will
hide most of the low level part of programming. And because of this, unless
you're trying to do some crazy ASM stuff or some very aggressive
optimizations,  C is all you need.


&gt;<i> Which one will help most with eLua?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
None, probably. What would help most with eLua is to understand the
peripherals of your MCU very well for at least two reasons:

1. the eLua peripheral modules (uart, pio, pwm...) might not expose the
whole functionality of your platform (this is almost always a work in
progress in eLua :) )
2. even if you have enough functionality in the eLua modules, you'll want to
check the implementation details of your peripherals. For example, PWM and
timers might use the same resources on one platform, and separate ones in
another platform. eLua won't help much there, you need to know your MPU well
enough to avoid this kind of stuff.

If you really want to learn ASM or C and you don't know what to choose,
choose C. (at least for starters) It has a much broader applicability, and
it's easier to grasp than most ASMs out there.

Best,
Bogdan
