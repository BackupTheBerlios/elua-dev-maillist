<PRE>Thanks for all the good news, Tony! You made my day.

</I>&gt;<i> 1. ST has expanded the STM32 Performance line with models with 96K SRAM and

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Excellent. I really like the STM32s. If their next step is to bump the RAM
to 128k, I'll probably marry that chip (sorry, wife). 96k is good enough
though, I have a board with a STM32F103RE (512kF/32kR) and it can do a lot
of nice stuff.


&gt;<i> 2. Microchip has PIC32MX MCUs with 128K SRAM and 512K flash in a QFP-64.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
WOW! Now this is something I really have to try soon. I have an older PIC32
board at home, but accessing its UART requires a connector that is hard to
find and even harder to solder, so I didn't touch it yet (although PIC32 has
been on eLua's TOPORT list for quite a while now). This is one thing about
Microchip's PIC32 boards that annoys me quite a bit: in order to have a
proper development environment for eLua (an UART, to be more precise), I'd
have to buy the PIC32 board (
<A HREF="http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&amp;nodeId=2615&amp;dDocName=en535536">http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&amp;nodeId=2615&amp;dDocName=en535536</A>)
which should be then stuck in a PIC32 I/O expansion board (
<A HREF="http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&amp;nodeId=2615&amp;dDocName=en535444">http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&amp;nodeId=2615&amp;dDocName=en535444</A>)
and I still have to use some sort of daugherboard in that one to get a
serial connector (if I don't feel like soldering, that is).
That said, I have to check if I can't use one of the on-board USB
connections as a CDC, this might simplify things quite a bit. I don't think
I have the time to develop a CDC device on PIC32 myself, but maybe they have
something like this in their software library. And who knows, maybe they're
even willing to sponsor us. Thanks for the hint! I had no idea about this
new line (new to me, as least :) ) of PIC32 devices.

3. If you want to go for broke, Renesas has the SH7216 series with 200MHz
&gt;<i> speed, FPU, 128K SRAM and 1024K flash -- but as usual with Renesas,
</I>&gt;<i> availability is poor and the price is high (Digikey only lists one model,
</I>&gt;<i> not in stock, for $42.27 qty 1).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
If they're not easily available in the US, chances are they aren't available
at all in Europe. I found it quite hard to find Renesas products in Europe.
Still, this chip sounds SWEET. Especially the FPU part.


&gt;<i> 4. Someday Renesas promises they'll have a new RX600 MCU with 256K SRAM and
</I>&gt;<i> 4M flash.  On the good side, Renesas does make a lot of very capable MCUs in
</I>&gt;<i> QFPs.  But, I'm not holding my breath waiting for availability (my guess is
</I>&gt;<i> it's at least several years away).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You're probably right, but it's very good to see this &quot;more on-board RAM and
Flash&quot; trend. Very nice for eLua, as we all know :)

Best,
Bogdan

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  When I subscribed to this list half a year ago I confidently expected to

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> was prepared to compromise with a second chip for this). With this type of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> distributed architecture, I need lots of IO versatility (analog, PWM, UART,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I2C, SPI, counters etc.) but multiplexed on relatively few pins since if you

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It is very disappointing that after many months still the only chip that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> comes near is the LPC2888 which seems to be buggy and expensive (the very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> minimalist LPC-H2888 prototype board is over $150). Looking at the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> schematics for this board really reinforced my intuition about the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> importance of on-chip memory &#8211; a ridiculous number of pins (and therefore
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> PCB traces) is wasted on the external memory interface. And the economics
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are terrible - for just $20 more, you can get the new Acer Aspire Revo R3600
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nettop (in Linux rather than Vista trim). The latter has both wired and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wireless networking, 1GB RAM and an 8GB SSD!

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A versatile USB to IO pins chip for only $8! This looks like great
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> universal IO problem solver. Unlike most other DIY USB solutions I&#8217;ve seen
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which require a driver and/or serial port emulator, this is HID based and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> therefore driverless on all major OS&#8217;s. I have ordered some of these chips
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and will report back how it goes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am beginning to think it might just be better to cooperate with market
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> forces here since I suspect that X86 computing is going to keep widening the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> functionality gap and reducing the price gap. Rather than trying to squeeze
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Lua onto a cramped chip with no operating system, would it maybe be better
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to produce a custom cut-down Linux distro with Lua built in (and perhaps
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> acting as the shell)?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
