<PRE>Even more single-chip eLua candidates are coming, so the situation is a bit
better than last year.

1. ST has expanded the STM32 Performance line with models with 96K SRAM and
768K or 1024K flash; packages include a 64-pin QFP.  Not sure on
availability, but should be fairly soon.
2. Microchip has PIC32MX MCUs with 128K SRAM and 512K flash in a QFP-64.
3. If you want to go for broke, Renesas has the SH7216 series with 200MHz
speed, FPU, 128K SRAM and 1024K flash -- but as usual with Renesas,
availability is poor and the price is high (Digikey only lists one model,
not in stock, for $42.27 qty 1).
4. Someday Renesas promises they'll have a new RX600 MCU with 256K SRAM and
4M flash.  On the good side, Renesas does make a lot of very capable MCUs in
QFPs.  But, I'm not holding my breath waiting for availability (my guess is
it's at least several years away).

&gt;<i>  When I subscribed to this list half a year ago I confidently expected to

</I>&gt;<i> use many such chips in a seriously distributed architecture with the
</I>&gt;<i> processing kept near to the IO to simplify wiring. To avoid buying an
</I>&gt;<i> endless succession of development boards I set a simple threshold
</I>&gt;<i> specification of 512K on-chip flash, 64K on-chip RAM, Ethernet capability (I
</I>&gt;<i> was prepared to compromise with a second chip for this). With this type of
</I>&gt;<i> distributed architecture, I need lots of IO versatility (analog, PWM, UART,
</I>&gt;<i> I2C, SPI, counters etc.) but multiplexed on relatively few pins since if you
</I>&gt;<i> run out of IO you just add another chip. It should therefore be possible to
</I>&gt;<i> have a simple 20-40 pin package which could be available in hand-solderable
</I>&gt;<i> form.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is very disappointing that after many months still the only chip that
</I>&gt;<i> comes near is the LPC2888 which seems to be buggy and expensive (the very
</I>&gt;<i> minimalist LPC-H2888 prototype board is over $150). Looking at the
</I>&gt;<i> schematics for this board really reinforced my intuition about the
</I>&gt;<i> importance of on-chip memory &#8211; a ridiculous number of pins (and therefore
</I>&gt;<i> PCB traces) is wasted on the external memory interface. And the economics
</I>&gt;<i> are terrible - for just $20 more, you can get the new Acer Aspire Revo R3600
</I>&gt;<i> nettop (in Linux rather than Vista trim). The latter has both wired and
</I>&gt;<i> wireless networking, 1GB RAM and an 8GB SSD!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> IO is the problem of course with an X86 platform. However in my research I
</I>&gt;<i> found this incredibly poorly marketed chip:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A versatile USB to IO pins chip for only $8! This looks like great
</I>&gt;<i> universal IO problem solver. Unlike most other DIY USB solutions I&#8217;ve seen
</I>&gt;<i> which require a driver and/or serial port emulator, this is HID based and
</I>&gt;<i> therefore driverless on all major OS&#8217;s. I have ordered some of these chips
</I>&gt;<i> and will report back how it goes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am beginning to think it might just be better to cooperate with market
</I>&gt;<i> forces here since I suspect that X86 computing is going to keep widening the
</I>&gt;<i> functionality gap and reducing the price gap. Rather than trying to squeeze
</I>&gt;<i> Lua onto a cramped chip with no operating system, would it maybe be better
</I>&gt;<i> to produce a custom cut-down Linux distro with Lua built in (and perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> acting as the shell)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What do others think? Will there be cheap, single chip ARM devices meeting
</I>&gt;<i> my spec available in the next few months?
