<PRE>I had a look at the datasheet last night. It looks ideal (on paper) - the
USB is actually capable of Host/Device/On-The-Go, so it could actually host
a MSD as well as acting as one (64GB anyone?). The Microchip stack does have
CDC also.

 

I prefer HID over CDC  for two reasons: On Windows virtual Com ports tend to
shuffle about at random and it is difficult to write host-side software that
can find the port number reliably in all circumstances without bothering the
user with technical details. Secondly, using HID allows the device to
emulate keyboard/mouse/game controllers without software on the host
computer. Microchip actually have two bootloader implementations one of
which uses HID and the other their own profile.

 

The Microchip stack also supports DOS file system in program memory
(accessible via MSD and the microcontroller app) which should simplify
implementation. Putting the Lua scripts in this file system with an
&quot;autorun.lua&quot; seems a good way forward to me - keeps things really simple
and cross-platform on the host computer.

I must look at PIC32 again myself! But is the serial port really necessary?
The MX chips have USB and the (free) Microchip USB stack does Mass Storage
Device as well as Human Interface Device (at least on the PIC 18 it does and
it will even do both at once).

Thanks, I didn't know that. The only PIC with USB I ever played with was a
18F21550, and I was greatly disappointed by it (more specifically by its USB
implementation, which was extremely sensitive to electrical noise, even
after I designed and build a PCB around it). I do expect an improvement in
PIC32 though. I hope it can also do CDC out of the box (I'm sure it can, but
I'm hoping to find support in Microchip's library for CDC, as I really don't
feel like writing that), so we can get our serial port one way or another.
Strictly speaking, a serial port is not *required* for eLua, but it does
simplify the interaction with eLua quite a bit.

Similar to the Mbed, would it not be possible to make the chip mount as a
disk drive on the host computer and edit the script files directly in place?

You probably could (James Snyder is already working on this for Mbed), but
you'd still need a way to run the scripts. Currently, the only way to run
without an explicit command from the shell is to have an &quot;autorun.lua&quot; file
that is executed at startup. We'll think of new ways of interaction if
needed :) 

Ideally there could be a switch on the board and you'd flip it one way for
MSD to load your scripts and flip it the other way to run the scripts with
access to USB as HID so you could create USB devices.

I wouldn't go the HID way if I can do CDC. I don't see the point. 

 Time for another look, I think - Thanks Tony!

Yeah, my thoughts exactly :)

Best,
Bogdan

Thanks for all the good news, Tony! You made my day.

Even more single-chip eLua candidates are coming, so the situation is a bit
better than last year.

1. ST has expanded the STM32 Performance line with models with 96K SRAM and
768K or 1024K flash; packages include a 64-pin QFP.  Not sure on
availability, but should be fairly soon.


Excellent. I really like the STM32s. If their next step is to bump the RAM
to 128k, I'll probably marry that chip (sorry, wife). 96k is good enough
though, I have a board with a STM32F103RE (512kF/32kR) and it can do a lot
of nice stuff.
 

2. Microchip has PIC32MX MCUs with 128K SRAM and 512K flash in a QFP-64.


WOW! Now this is something I really have to try soon. I have an older PIC32
board at home, but accessing its UART requires a connector that is hard to
find and even harder to solder, so I didn't touch it yet (although PIC32 has
been on eLua's TOPORT list for quite a while now). This is one thing about
Microchip's PIC32 boards that annoys me quite a bit: in order to have a
proper development environment for eLua (an UART, to be more precise), I'd
have to buy the PIC32 board
(<A HREF="http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE">http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE</A>
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&amp;nodeId=2615">http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&amp;nodeId=2615</A>
&amp;dDocName=en535536&gt; &amp;nodeId=2615&amp;dDocName=en535536) which should be then
stuck in a PIC32 I/O expansion board
(<A HREF="http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE">http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE</A>

&amp;dDocName=en535444&gt; &amp;nodeId=2615&amp;dDocName=en535444) and I still have to use
some sort of daugherboard in that one to get a serial connector (if I don't
feel like soldering, that is). 
That said, I have to check if I can't use one of the on-board USB
connections as a CDC, this might simplify things quite a bit. I don't think
I have the time to develop a CDC device on PIC32 myself, but maybe they have
something like this in their software library. And who knows, maybe they're
even willing to sponsor us. Thanks for the hint! I had no idea about this
new line (new to me, as least :) ) of PIC32 devices.

3. If you want to go for broke, Renesas has the SH7216 series with 200MHz
speed, FPU, 128K SRAM and 1024K flash -- but as usual with Renesas,
availability is poor and the price is high (Digikey only lists one model,
not in stock, for $42.27 qty 1).


If they're not easily available in the US, chances are they aren't available
at all in Europe. I found it quite hard to find Renesas products in Europe.
Still, this chip sounds SWEET. Especially the FPU part.
 

4. Someday Renesas promises they'll have a new RX600 MCU with 256K SRAM and
4M flash.  On the good side, Renesas does make a lot of very capable MCUs in
QFPs.  But, I'm not holding my breath waiting for availability (my guess is
it's at least several years away).


You're probably right, but it's very good to see this &quot;more on-board RAM and
Flash&quot; trend. Very nice for eLua, as we all know :)

Best,
Bogdan

When I subscribed to this list half a year ago I confidently expected to be
able to use a single chip Lua device in my projects by now. I wanted to use
many such chips in a seriously distributed architecture with the processing
kept near to the IO to simplify wiring. To avoid buying an endless
succession of development boards I set a simple threshold specification of
512K on-chip flash, 64K on-chip RAM, Ethernet capability (I was prepared to
compromise with a second chip for this). With this type of distributed
architecture, I need lots of IO versatility (analog, PWM, UART, I2C, SPI,
counters etc.) but multiplexed on relatively few pins since if you run out
of IO you just add another chip. It should therefore be possible to have a
simple 20-40 pin package which could be available in hand-solderable form.

 

It is very disappointing that after many months still the only chip that
comes near is the LPC2888 which seems to be buggy and expensive (the very
minimalist LPC-H2888 prototype board is over $150). Looking at the
schematics for this board really reinforced my intuition about the
importance of on-chip memory - a ridiculous number of pins (and therefore
PCB traces) is wasted on the external memory interface. And the economics
are terrible - for just $20 more, you can get the new Acer Aspire Revo R3600
nettop (in Linux rather than Vista trim). The latter has both wired and
wireless networking, 1GB RAM and an 8GB SSD!

 

IO is the problem of course with an X86 platform. However in my research I
found this incredibly poorly marketed chip:

 

<A HREF="http://delcomproduct.com/products_USBIO.asp#DemoBrd">http://delcomproduct.com/products_USBIO.asp#DemoBrd</A>

 

A versatile USB to IO pins chip for only $8! This looks like great universal
IO problem solver. Unlike most other DIY USB solutions I've seen which
require a driver and/or serial port emulator, this is HID based and
therefore driverless on all major OS's. I have ordered some of these chips
and will report back how it goes.

 

I am beginning to think it might just be better to cooperate with market
forces here since I suspect that X86 computing is going to keep widening the
functionality gap and reducing the price gap. Rather than trying to squeeze
Lua onto a cramped chip with no operating system, would it maybe be better
to produce a custom cut-down Linux distro with Lua built in (and perhaps
acting as the shell)?

 

What do others think? Will there be cheap, single chip ARM devices meeting
my spec available in the next few months?
