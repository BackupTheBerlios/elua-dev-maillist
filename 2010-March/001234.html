</I>&gt;<i> script files directly in place?
</I>
FYI the way the MBED does this is by having 2 chips on the board, one
is the main NXP LPC1768, and the other one is the &quot;mbed interface&quot;
(another nxp mcu), and it's the interface one that's dedicated to
providing mass storage and the CDC (virtual serial port).  The other
chip, I believe, doesn't have any direct connection to the USB port,
and doesn't need to know about it either.  Programming is done by a
JTAG link between the interface chip and the main LPC1768.

Does the PIC32 have a USB bootloader for programming as well, that
would make this even more convenient.

&gt;<i> Ideally there could be a switch on the board and you&#8217;d flip it one way for
</I>&gt;<i> MSD to load your scripts and flip it the other way to run the scripts with
</I>&gt;<i> access to USB as HID so you could create USB devices.
</I>
You could also handle this in software where depending on whether the
mass storage device has been mounted on one side or the other, the
storage would be locked out for the opposite side (or read-only?).

</I>&gt;<i> Even more single-chip eLua candidates are coming, so the situation is a bit

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. ST has expanded the STM32 Performance line with models with 96K SRAM and
</I>&gt;<i> 768K or 1024K flash; packages include a 64-pin QFP.&#160; Not sure on
</I>&gt;<i> availability, but should be fairly soon.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Excellent. I really like the STM32s. If their next step is to bump the RAM
</I>&gt;<i> to 128k, I'll probably marry that chip (sorry, wife). 96k is good enough
</I>&gt;<i> though, I have a board with a STM32F103RE (512kF/32kR) and it can do a lot
</I>&gt;<i> of nice stuff.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Microchip has PIC32MX MCUs with 128K SRAM and 512K flash in a QFP-64.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> WOW! Now this is something I really have to try soon. I have an older PIC32
</I>&gt;<i> board at home, but accessing its UART requires a connector that is hard to
</I>&gt;<i> find and even harder to solder, so I didn't touch it yet (although PIC32 has
</I>&gt;<i> been on eLua's TOPORT list for quite a while now). This is one thing about
</I>&gt;<i> Microchip's PIC32 boards that annoys me quite a bit: in order to have a
</I>&gt;<i> proper development environment for eLua (an UART, to be more precise), I'd
</I>&gt;<i> have to buy the PIC32 board
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&amp;nodeId=2615&amp;dDocName=en535536">http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&amp;nodeId=2615&amp;dDocName=en535536</A>)
</I>&gt;<i> which should be then stuck in a PIC32 I/O expansion board
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&amp;nodeId=2615&amp;dDocName=en535444">http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&amp;nodeId=2615&amp;dDocName=en535444</A>)
</I>&gt;<i> and I still have to use some sort of daugherboard in that one to get a
</I>&gt;<i> serial connector (if I don't feel like soldering, that is).
</I>&gt;<i> That said, I have to check if I can't use one of the on-board USB
</I>&gt;<i> connections as a CDC, this might simplify things quite a bit. I don't think
</I>&gt;<i> I have the time to develop a CDC device on PIC32 myself, but maybe they have
</I>&gt;<i> something like this in their software library. And who knows, maybe they're
</I>&gt;<i> even willing to sponsor us. Thanks for the hint! I had no idea about this
</I>&gt;<i> new line (new to me, as least :) ) of PIC32 devices.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. If you want to go for broke, Renesas has the SH7216 series with 200MHz
</I>&gt;<i> speed, FPU, 128K SRAM and 1024K flash -- but as usual with Renesas,
</I>&gt;<i> availability is poor and the price is high (Digikey only lists one model,
</I>&gt;<i> not in stock, for $42.27 qty 1).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If they're not easily available in the US, chances are they aren't available
</I>&gt;<i> at all in Europe. I found it quite hard to find Renesas products in Europe.
</I>&gt;<i> Still, this chip sounds SWEET. Especially the FPU part.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Someday Renesas promises they'll have a new RX600 MCU with 256K SRAM and
</I>&gt;<i> 4M flash.&#160; On the good side, Renesas does make a lot of very capable MCUs in
</I>&gt;<i> QFPs.&#160; But, I'm not holding my breath waiting for availability (my guess is
</I>&gt;<i> it's at least several years away).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You're probably right, but it's very good to see this &quot;more on-board RAM and
</I>&gt;<i> Flash&quot; trend. Very nice for eLua, as we all know :)
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> When I subscribed to this list half a year ago I confidently expected to be
</I>&gt;<i> able to use a single chip Lua device in my projects by now. I wanted to use
</I>&gt;<i> many such chips in a seriously distributed architecture with the processing
</I>&gt;<i> kept near to the IO to simplify wiring. To avoid buying an endless
</I>&gt;<i> succession of development boards I set a simple threshold specification of
</I>&gt;<i> 512K on-chip flash, 64K on-chip RAM, Ethernet capability (I was prepared to
</I>&gt;<i> compromise with a second chip for this). With this type of distributed
</I>&gt;<i> architecture, I need lots of IO versatility (analog, PWM, UART, I2C, SPI,
</I>&gt;<i> counters etc.) but multiplexed on relatively few pins since if you run out
</I>&gt;<i> of IO you just add another chip. It should therefore be possible to have a
</I>&gt;<i> simple 20-40 pin package which could be available in hand-solderable form.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is very disappointing that after many months still the only chip that
</I>&gt;<i> comes near is the LPC2888 which seems to be buggy and expensive (the very
</I>&gt;<i> minimalist LPC-H2888 prototype board is over $150). Looking at the
</I>&gt;<i> schematics for this board really reinforced my intuition about the
</I>&gt;<i> importance of on-chip memory &#8211; a ridiculous number of pins (and therefore
</I>&gt;<i> PCB traces) is wasted on the external memory interface. And the economics
</I>&gt;<i> are terrible - for just $20 more, you can get the new Acer Aspire Revo R3600
</I>&gt;<i> nettop (in Linux rather than Vista trim). The latter has both wired and
</I>&gt;<i> wireless networking, 1GB RAM and an 8GB SSD!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> IO is the problem of course with an X86 platform. However in my research I
</I>&gt;<i> found this incredibly poorly marketed chip:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A versatile USB to IO pins chip for only $8! This looks like great universal
</I>&gt;<i> IO problem solver. Unlike most other DIY USB solutions I&#8217;ve seen which
</I>&gt;<i> require a driver and/or serial port emulator, this is HID based and
</I>&gt;<i> therefore driverless on all major OS&#8217;s. I have ordered some of these chips
</I>&gt;<i> and will report back how it goes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am beginning to think it might just be better to cooperate with market
</I>&gt;<i> forces here since I suspect that X86 computing is going to keep widening the
</I>&gt;<i> functionality gap and reducing the price gap. Rather than trying to squeeze
</I>&gt;<i> Lua onto a cramped chip with no operating system, would it maybe be better
</I>&gt;<i> to produce a custom cut-down Linux distro with Lua built in (and perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> acting as the shell)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What do others think? Will there be cheap, single chip ARM devices meeting
</I>&gt;<i> my spec available in the next few months?
