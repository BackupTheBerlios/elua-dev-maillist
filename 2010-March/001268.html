I think that's a great idea :-)  I certainly have more than enough
that I could ramble on about during the interview.  The hosts will be
directing the questions, but  , from my recollection, many are general
enough where there's some latitude possible in the answers, and
suggestions would be good.  As such, here's a google moderator series
for suggestions:

I certainly can't guarantee that I'll get to things posted there
during the interview, but I'll definitely keep an eye on it as April
7th draws close :-)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am trying to make my way around the eLua site but here are a few things

</I>&gt;<i> 1)I have no background in C/assembly programming of microcontrollers, I am

</I>
I suppose there are two parts to this question, one is on the side of
general conventions in microcontrollers, and the other is how one
would use these through eLua.  Generally, though we're abstracting
things, we do so in a way that's still rather similar to the
underlying hardware model, so, hopefully, a general description of how
GPIO works (general logic control related to pins) would be applicable
to eLua's model.  I think we have some decent coverage for translating
general microcontroller knowledge to how that could be applied with
eLua, but we don't bridge the gap as much from less microcontroller
familiarity.

I think we could certainly benefit from having some more guides on
that level, and while I suspect it's possible to generate quite a
large volume of documentation (medium sized tome :-) from doing
something like this thoroughly, we might be able to get away with some
tutorial basics and then point to a more extensive description of the
details elsewhere plus our API docs.  I suspect it might be easier to
put together some off-the-cuff screencasts on certain topics, maybe I
could make one on the question you've asked above as a test, if I get
some time for it this week/weekend?  I make no guarantees that this
will become a series, but I am more likely to do things when there
people interested and pinging me about it :-)

If I understand correctly, is what you're wondering about how to use
GPIO (using pins for digital input/output, and how one can control
them as groups?) or is this a more general question that includes
things like how pins can be used for Serial, ADC, CAN, etc...?

&gt;<i> 2)I know many chips will be different but what is the general hardware that
</I>&gt;<i> is needed for this, is everything done via Jtag?
</I>
As Dado was saying, it depends :-)   We have guides for many of them.
Some platforms like STM32 have a serial bootloader that makes it
really easy to load firmware from a simple cross-platform tool
(there's a Python tool, and now Bogdan has also started a C-based
version which will eventually make it into the project, but for now is
up on github: <A HREF="http://github.com/jsnyder/stm32ld">http://github.com/jsnyder/stm32ld</A>).  One new platform,
the mbed (<A HREF="http://mbed.org/">http://mbed.org/</A>) has a mass storage filesystem that allows
one to simply copy a new firmware version to the filesystem and hit
the reset button to load it up.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3)Is this project at production level?
</I>
Adding to Dado's comments:
Also, note that a large portion of the code that's actually running is
directly derived from Lua 5.1.4.  We've added some patches (Lua Tiny
RAM, Emergency Garbage Collection (which is used by other projects),
etc..) and some modules, but the core Lua code is used by a reasonably
large number of people and has a deliberately slow release pace to
ensure that what gets released is quite stable.  In my personal
experience, what we've been releasing is pretty stable, and while
there are likely bugs, I don't know of any right now that cause the VM
to crash (it will bail if it runs out of memory and EGC didn't help).
So... While I wouldn't use it to replace the drive-by-wire system in a
car, it's not too bad :-)
