</I>
I would certainly agree that for file transfer and various packetized
protocols, various USB profiles are certainly going to provide a more
reliable and higher throughput option compared with something like
RS232 or CDC. But I suppose the question needs to be answered: &quot;What
interaction models do we want?&quot;

I think being able to do MSD dramatically simplifies the concept of
transferring data back and forth (though it has downsides like 2
devices can't mount it at the same time).  I'm not sure what of any
proprietary packetized formats might make sense for us in a general
sense, since a lot of those are geared towards one particular use.
Perhaps there are open ones as well, beyond the basic device classes
that might make for a generalized programmatic interface we could
provide, but none are coming to mind at the moment.

Right now our development paradigm involves either working with eLua
over a serial console as a command-line shell/interpreter or using
something like LuaRPC for a programmatic interaction model with a VM
running on the microcontroller.  Certainly for the former, I think a
CDC (or similar) makes the most sense, and I would argue that having a
device class like this is always going to be useful on some level if
for nothing else that it provides a really easy way to make ad-hoc
communications between the embedded device and a desktop.  Getting
some data from a device is as simple as opening a terminal and having
some print statements in the program.  It might not be very
sophisticated, but it's a nice fallback when one is getting started or
wants to get quick details about program operation

Now, I could definitely see the benefit of using some sort of
packetized usb-based communication channel for supporting LuaRPC, it
would be less complicated (presumably) than using TCP/IP and it would
give you better throughput, latency, etc and would provide an
extensible model for user and developer interaction without having to
delve into the details of how the USB link works.  I would still want
some sort of tty-like interface as a fallback, though.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Conceptually the problem with RS232/ASCII/tty is that it is not a complete
</I>&gt;<i> communications stack except for the intended teletype application. All the
</I>&gt;<i> actual modern applications require additional layers on top. In contrast,
</I>&gt;<i> the USB profiles are complete specifications right up to the application
</I>&gt;<i> layer.
</I>
Right, I would agree. Especially without the control lines it has
pitfalls, especially with large quantities of data transmission and
small buffers, but so far it's actually worked reasonably well for us.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The clincher for me is that you can do HID and MSD on any modern platform
</I>&gt;<i> without an additional device driver.
</I>
I'm not sure if I'm missing something, but if one wants to use HID and
present as something other than a mouse or keyboard, doesn't one need
a driver?  Using libusb might make it a user-space driver rather than
a kernel-space one, but I think you still need a driver if you want to
do something other than a human interface device.

&gt;<i> I'm not sure why, or if this is just a
</I>&gt;<i> Windows problem, but you do need to source and install a manufacturer
</I>&gt;<i> specific device driver to do CDC. If you stick with FTDI-based devices, the
</I>&gt;<i> driver seems to be OK, but I have had endless problems with the (more common
</I>&gt;<i> in over-the-counter USB-Serial converters) Prolific chip drivers on Vista
</I>&gt;<i> and Windows 7.
</I>
They've all just popped up for me on OS X &amp; Linux without any drivers,
but I think you're right about windows wanting something. I can't
imagine it being much more than a stub that has device and vendor data
and indicates that it should show up as a COM port, though.

FTDI devices are pretty nice, and they also have a programmatic
interface which you can access through a library they provide or with
libftdi (<A HREF="http://www.intra2net.com/en/developer/libftdi/">http://www.intra2net.com/en/developer/libftdi/</A>).
