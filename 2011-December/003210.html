<PRE>Hi,

(quick reply, I'm on vacation and on my ipad)

On Thursday, December 29, 2011, Martin Guy &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/elua-dev">martinwguy at gmail.com</A>&gt; wrote:
&gt;<i> In the recent &quot;system timer&quot; mods, an additional change was made that

</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i>    tmr.delay(delay, timer_id)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and similarly for the other tmr.*() functions
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please let us think again about this change, about which there was no
</I>&gt;<i> discussion that I saw.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The very small advantage of it is to be able to write
</I>&gt;<i>     tmr.delay(100)
</I>&gt;<i> instead of
</I>&gt;<i>     tmr.delay(tmr.SYS_TIMER, 100)
</I>&gt;<i> which is just syntactic sugar with no operational advantage.
</I>
The main idea was definitely NOT syntax sugar. It was that the user
shouldn't have to worry about timer IDs in the first place (and that this
was a big problem with the original design) except for some rare cases.
This philosophy should also be reflected in the API.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The disavantages are
</I>&gt;<i> - it breaks almost all code ever written for eLua
</I>
which isn't that much code yet. I shoud have made it explicit somewhere
that API changes are to EXPECTED until 1.0. actually i will add this to the
docs.

&gt;<i> - it makes it impossible to write code that works in different
</I>&gt;<i> versions of eLua, unless you do all delays with for loops tuned to the
</I>&gt;<i> CPU speed and use timers for nothing else, since there is no sane way
</I>&gt;<i> to find out which syntax is being used.
</I>&gt;<i> - all existing firmware that we have produced and shipped would need
</I>&gt;<i> changing if we decide to follow this change, and all the alternate
</I>&gt;<i> firmware versions we have published become junk
</I>
Obsolete syntax/modules/functions are a reality in a lot of software
projects. They exist now and they will continue to exist in elua in the
future. The solution is not to forget about them, just to find a better way
to handle them (see below).

&gt;<i> - people writing eLua video tutorials cannot speak about timers unless
</I>&gt;<i> they include a section on changing the syntax according to which
</I>&gt;<i> version of eLua you are using, or resign themselves to it not working
</I>&gt;<i> in all existing (or all future) boards
</I>
True. Patrick would agree with you wholehearteadly :)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Code that users send me asking me to help resolve bugs now contains stuff
</I>like:
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                if new_elua then
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                        tmr.delay( delay_time, timer_id )
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                else
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                        tmr.delay( timer_id, delay_time )
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                end
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (this is an example from today!). Before this sort of thing becomes
</I>&gt;<i> commonplace, or before people resort to inventing tricks to discover
</I>&gt;<i> which is the syntax is today's firmware, PLEASE can we go back to the
</I>&gt;<i> original parameter order?
</I>
As far as I am concerned, the answer is no. I simply find the new way much
more natural and logical.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a compromise we could let tmr.delay(nil, 100) to mean &quot;use the
</I>&gt;<i> system timer&quot;, which is less ugly without breaking everything.
</I>
As always, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. for me, tmr.delay(nil,100)
is ugly as sin and leaves anybody not familiar with the API wondering &quot;WTF
does that mean?&quot; tmr.delay(100) is much more clear and descriptive.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also notice that three new system variables tmr.SYS_TIMER,
</I>&gt;<i> uart.SYS_TIMER and net.SYS_TIMER have appeared.  What are the second
</I>&gt;<i> two for?
</I>
just for completion, they all reffer to the system timer ID. I understand
why they can be confusing, there's no problem if we remove them.

conclusion: i believe API changes are both necessarry and unavoidable. We
can make the API transition smoother by designing a deprecation mechanism.
The users will be able to use the old API as usual for a while (for example
until the next official release) with a warning from eLua, being able to
experiment with the new API at the same time. The old API will still be
there for a number of versions, but under a different name, then it will
disappear completely.
An example for the timer module:

tmr.delay(tmr.SYS_TIMER, 100) --current version
future.tmr.delay(100) -- this is going to be used in the future

(this mirrors partially the idea of futures found in Python)

Or:

local tmr=tmr -- to use the old version
local tmr= future.tmr -- to use the new version

I'm making this up as i write, so i'm sure it has lots of drawbacks (in
particular, i'd be very happy if we can avoid module versioning) and can be
improved a lot. I'm opened to suggestions in this area.

Bogdan
