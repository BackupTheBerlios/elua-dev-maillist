<PRE>Up front comment: It would be really great if we could get opinions
from not just people with commit access on this one, feel free to
weigh in here even if it's just a simple yay or nay type of response.

</I>
This is true, and changes like this in trunk have often lead by
&quot;here's working code&quot; that gets merged in rather than having drawn out
discussions.  That said, I think whatever opinions people may hold
we're not feeling bound to one approach or the other and switching to
a new one should be done on merits as well as the fact that there's
already an working implementation.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The very small advantage of it is to be able to write
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; tmr.delay(100)
</I>&gt;<i> instead of
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; tmr.delay(tmr.SYS_TIMER, 100)
</I>&gt;<i> which is just syntactic sugar with no operational advantage.
</I>
I think the suggested operational advantage was to discourage the use
of individual timers for every last hardware or software component
that needed some type of timing service, with the idea being that in
90-some-ercent of cases people would be typing tmr.delay( delay_time )
with no timer being specified.

Yes, it's also just syntactic sugar.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The disavantages are
</I>&gt;<i> - it breaks almost all code ever written for eLua
</I>&gt;<i> - it makes it impossible to write code that works in different
</I>&gt;<i> versions of eLua, unless you do all delays with for loops tuned to the
</I>&gt;<i> CPU speed and use timers for nothing else, since there is no sane way
</I>&gt;<i> to find out which syntax is being used.
</I>&gt;<i> - all existing firmware that we have produced and shipped would need
</I>&gt;<i> changing if we decide to follow this change, and all the alternate
</I>&gt;<i> firmware versions we have published become junk
</I>&gt;<i> - people writing eLua video tutorials cannot speak about timers unless
</I>&gt;<i> they include a section on changing the syntax according to which
</I>&gt;<i> version of eLua you are using, or resign themselves to it not working
</I>&gt;<i> in all existing (or all future) boards
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Code that users send me asking me to help resolve bugs now contains stuff like:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;if new_elua then
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;tmr.delay( delay_time, timer_id )
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;else
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;tmr.delay( timer_id, delay_time )
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;end
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (this is an example from today!). Before this sort of thing becomes
</I>&gt;<i> commonplace, or before people resort to inventing tricks to discover
</I>&gt;<i> which is the syntax is today's firmware, PLEASE can we go back to the
</I>&gt;<i> original parameter order?
</I>
My biggest issue with the ordering change is not even so much that
it's a reordering of parameters, but that it differs from the behavior
of every other module that consumes a hardware resource, which puts
the resource first followed by the parameter(s) to be applied to it.
Also, I rather don't like the ordering for tmr.gettimediff: end,
start, [id]

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a compromise we could let tmr.delay(nil, 100) to mean &quot;use the
</I>&gt;<i> system timer&quot;, which is less ugly without breaking everything.
</I>
That's perhaps not a bad option.  I also wouldn't mind the approach I
mentioned in an earlier message which was essentially to provide
wrappers to use the system timer:
tmr.sys.delay( delay_time) == tmr.delay(tmr.SYS_TIMER, delay_time )
etc..

It might be a tad slower on each call, but it would probably be pretty
space efficient to handle the difference with a metamethod or two.

I'd be fine with this or the 'nil' id approach.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also notice that three new system variables tmr.SYS_TIMER,
</I>&gt;<i> uart.SYS_TIMER and net.SYS_TIMER have appeared. &#160;What are the second
</I>&gt;<i> two for?
</I>
Not sure.
