<PRE>Hi Everyone

Here is a list of screencasts I would be interested in doing over the 
next few months. If it would not be a case of spam, I could post 
questions about these topics and then record a screencast the next day. 
We could do this a little at a time. The email train might even be a 
foundation for a wiki-book on elua. If I could get some coaching, I 
could learn a lot.

Please let me know what you think, should some of these be deleted? are 
there other topics that should be added?

Once this is complete, would this knowledge base approximate the level 
of a entry level professional embedded designer? Again, Arduino is great 
but I think it's more about providing an outlet for those who don't want 
to work as embedded designers. I am thinking that the elua way of doing 
things is a better education. It provides a gentle introduction but then 
can be manipulated at lower levels such as C or even ASM and that a GCC 
centric tool chain would provide nearly endless options later, at least 
when compared with some manufacture's closed source IDE

Thanks-Patrick
