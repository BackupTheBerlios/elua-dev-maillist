<PRE>Hi Bogdan, Hi List

[snip]
&gt;<i> That would definitely help, but maybe something like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.lua.org/source/5.1/">http://www.lua.org/source/5.1/</A>
</I>Thanks for the link, this greatly simplifies what I want to do. If I 
just list the tags by their frequency of occurrence and transform them 
into links to this portion of the site, i will be able to follow along 
with the source code, most common parts first.

[snip]
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     However I am planning on holding the reset line of the CPU(thanks
</I>&gt;<i>     to Bogdan for the reset suggestion) 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't remember making this suggestion, but I'll gladly accept the 
</I>&gt;<i> thanks :)
</I>You did! September 10 2010 at 09:11 A.M :)
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     and then high-jacking the peripherals of the instrumentation. This
</I>&gt;<i>     might be a good way to showcase elua on commercial hardware(other
</I>&gt;<i>     then development boards), I could use it to control displays,
</I>&gt;<i>     motors, valves, heating elements and such. I could make videos of
</I>&gt;<i>     this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Absolutely. If you can document your work, please do so, it's of huge 
</I>&gt;<i> help to the community.
</I>[snip ]
Great, I think this will help me to learn more about the circuits I work 
with too, a win-win for everyone
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This sort of stuff is perfect for us. One of the areas where eLua is 
</I>&gt;<i> lacking at this point is user friendlniess. Such of in-depth, easy to 
</I>&gt;<i> follow tutorials are always helpful and add great value to the 
</I>&gt;<i> project. So I encourage you to do this from all my heart.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     [ snip]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I chatted with James last night on IRC and he was supportive of this 
too. This should be my first focus.

One concern is that I hate my own writings, I regret 50% of what I 
write. I am thinking about doing some screencasts instead(although I am 
not against written tutorials if someone sanity checks them for me), 
hope this is alright.

I could break them up in to short 2 or 3 minute videos. If someone found 
an error or an omission I could redo them without much pain. I could 
then link them together into longer videos. If people can coach me, I 
will learn a lot about embedded design by doing them, again win-win.
&gt;<i> Lately I've been having even less time than &quot;usual&quot; to work on eLua
</I>[snip]
You've done a lot already!!
[snip]
&gt;<i> - another area is applications written in eLua itself; again, these 
</I>&gt;<i> are valuable no matter how the project will evolve. ]
</I>Yes it would be nice to have more project examples, in time I would like 
to help out here too. I think Arduino is a great project and there are 
lots of examples and documentation but I think elua has more potential 
to bring me up to speed with professional level embedded design. I would 
like to master gcc and professional tools like jtag/swd and such. Closed 
source toolchains look even worse. Elua will help me but won't sink it's 
teeth in :)
&gt;<i> - something we seriously lack is testing in general and automated 
</I>&gt;<i> testing in particular. An automated testing framework would be 
</I>&gt;<i> something quite new (and extremely helpful) for eLua. If you want to 
</I>&gt;<i> get your hands on something like this, we can help.
</I>I would like to but I will need some time to bring my skills up.
&gt;<i> Everybody, please feel free to share your ideas here. Patrick wants to 
</I>&gt;<i> help us, let's make him regret his decision :)
</I>:<i>)
</I>
I will put together a list of possible tutorials in the next couple of days

Thanks again !
