&gt;<i> Hi Everyone

</I>
Hi Patrick! Welcome back :)


&gt;<i> I haven't had much spare time for the past year or so and haven't spent
</I>&gt;<i> much time with elua. The time I have had has mostly been spent on more
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;crack-smoken&quot; ideas that didn't go anywhere.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Despite going around and around in circles I have learned from my failures
</I>&gt;<i> and I think I am back on a realistic track.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to help with the project, I am wondering what would be the
</I>&gt;<i> best way?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here are some random snippets of things, perhaps someone could guide me so
</I>&gt;<i> that one or more of them could be useful to the project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am about 80% through a small script that will help me learn codebases.
</I>&gt;<i> It is built on top of etags. Etags(or cousin ctags) are commands that will
</I>&gt;<i> locate the site of a declaration. The program I am writing takes these tags
</I>&gt;<i> and line number they are declared at and then sorts them by frequency. I
</I>&gt;<i> then want to use my script to copy and past the top few hundred most common
</I>&gt;<i> tags and the code snippet it was declared in and put it in a database. This
</I>&gt;<i> might be handy to learn lua and the elau layer on top of it, perhaps it
</I>&gt;<i> will teach me more about the project and help others learn the C portion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That would definitely help, but maybe something like this:

<A HREF="http://www.lua.org/source/5.1/">http://www.lua.org/source/5.1/</A>

would help even more. I'm not sure yet how and where we'd be able to set
something like that, but it might be useful.


&gt;<i> I have liquidated a lot of the scientific instruments I have here but I
</I>&gt;<i> still have quite a few left and some are not worth much.  They are all
</I>&gt;<i> built on Motorola 8 and 16 bit CPUs and I don't think I can get elua on
</I>&gt;<i> these devices.
</I>

This tasks ranges from &quot;impossible to do&quot; to &quot;maybe doable with significant
effort&quot;. Personally, I wouldn't try it :)


&gt;<i> However I am planning on holding the reset line of the CPU(thanks to
</I>&gt;<i> Bogdan for the reset suggestion)
</I>

I don't remember making this suggestion, but I'll gladly accept the thanks
:<i>)
</I>

&gt;<i> and then high-jacking the peripherals of the instrumentation. This might
</I>&gt;<i> be a good way to showcase elua on commercial hardware(other then
</I>&gt;<i> development boards), I could use it to control displays, motors, valves,
</I>&gt;<i> heating elements and such. I could make videos of this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Absolutely. If you can document your work, please do so, it's of huge help
to the community.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another thing that might be useful is an &quot;end-to-end&quot; tutorial on setting
</I>&gt;<i> up and elua based microcontroller lab. I believe I already have most of the
</I>&gt;<i> hardware that most people would want to program and test embedded devices
</I>&gt;<i> and I could create a tutorial on setting up such a lab and using elua.
</I>&gt;<i> Since I last visited the elua site there have been a lot of improvements
</I>&gt;<i> and many of these topics have already been covered. Perhaps such an
</I>&gt;<i> end-to-end tutorial would just point people to the work that was already
</I>&gt;<i> done and fill in the gaps rather then recreating work that has already been
</I>&gt;<i> completed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This sort of stuff is perfect for us. One of the areas where eLua is
lacking at this point is user friendlniess. Such of in-depth, easy to
follow tutorials are always helpful and add great value to the project. So
I encourage you to do this from all my heart.


&gt;<i> My mind has been racing for a few years now. I make a killing with my
</I>&gt;<i> business for an hour a week or so and then squandering money and time for
</I>&gt;<i> many more hours. I truly am a HalfMadDad(my IRC handle) I would really
</I>&gt;<i> appreciate guidance so that I don't continue to waste time and resources.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Lately I've been having even less time than &quot;usual&quot; to work on eLua and I
don't know how this will evolve in the future, so at this point I simply
can't give you specifics about how the project will evolve, because I don't
know them. These are some generic points:

- once again, you can't go wrong with tutorials. Regardless of the
project's directions, they will always be helpful. So, if you like doing
this kind of stuff and want to do it for eLua, this is a perfect match.
- another area is applications written in eLua itself; again, these are
valuable no matter how the project will evolve.
- something we seriously lack is testing in general and automated testing
in particular. An automated testing framework would be something quite new
(and extremely helpful) for eLua. If you want to get your hands on
something like this, we can help.

Everybody, please feel free to share your ideas here. Patrick wants to help
us, let's make him regret his decision :)

Best,
Bogdan
