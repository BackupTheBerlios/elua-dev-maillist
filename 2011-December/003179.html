The current IP stack hasn't had a great deal of change recently, but does have some outstanding issues that should be improved upon in an upcoming, yet to be merged, branch that Bogdan has been working on, the fruits of which I think are mostly here:
<A HREF="https://github.com/elua/elua/tree/newstack">https://github.com/elua/elua/tree/newstack</A>
(I can't speak to the state of that on LM3S at the moment, perhaps Bogdan can chime in)

As for LuaSockets, it would be nice to have either a compatibility layer or just an interface that behaved like the LuaSockets API.  I'm not sure we could easily include the support modules, but perhaps at least the basic API might be straightforward?

Yeah, there's no way to get directory listings aside from using the raw C api.  I haven't looked at the innards of LFS or luaposix, but I'm sure we could implement as much of the API as makes sense for eLua, and then support a pretty wide cross section of Lua scripts or at least an API people are familiar with.  It's certainly fairly fundamental and useful functionality.

I wonder how much code or ram overhead we might be talking about to implement these. 

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Bla bla luaposix the same kind of argument

</I>&gt;<i> I think that would make eLua more Lua-like as well as enabing us to

</I>
Sounds good.  One thing is though that one will still need a reasonably beefy mcu ram-wise to run a wide cross section of desktop code out of the box. However, it does provide a convenient way to test code on desktop lua before running on embedded targets.

&gt;<i>
