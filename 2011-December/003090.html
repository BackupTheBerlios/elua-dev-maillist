<PRE>Hi Everyone

I haven't had much spare time for the past year or so and haven't spent 
much time with elua. The time I have had has mostly been spent on more 
&quot;crack-smoken&quot; ideas that didn't go anywhere.

Despite going around and around in circles I have learned from my 
failures and I think I am back on a realistic track.

I would like to help with the project, I am wondering what would be the 
best way?

Here are some random snippets of things, perhaps someone could guide me 
so that one or more of them could be useful to the project.

I am about 80% through a small script that will help me learn codebases. 
It is built on top of etags. Etags(or cousin ctags) are commands that 
will locate the site of a declaration. The program I am writing takes 
these tags and line number they are declared at and then sorts them by 
frequency. I then want to use my script to copy and past the top few 
hundred most common tags and the code snippet it was declared in and put 
it in a database. This might be handy to learn lua and the elau layer on 
top of it, perhaps it will teach me more about the project and help 
others learn the C portion.

I have liquidated a lot of the scientific instruments I have here but I 
still have quite a few left and some are not worth much.  They are all 
built on Motorola 8 and 16 bit CPUs and I don't think I can get elua on 
these devices. However I am planning on holding the reset line of the 
CPU(thanks to Bogdan for the reset suggestion) and then high-jacking the 
peripherals of the instrumentation. This might be a good way to showcase 
elua on commercial hardware(other then development boards), I could use 
it to control displays, motors, valves, heating elements and such. I 
could make videos of this.

Another thing that might be useful is an &quot;end-to-end&quot; tutorial on 
setting up and elua based microcontroller lab. I believe I already have 
most of the hardware that most people would want to program and test 
embedded devices and I could create a tutorial on setting up such a lab 
and using elua. Since I last visited the elua site there have been a lot 
of improvements and many of these topics have already been covered. 
Perhaps such an end-to-end tutorial would just point people to the work 
that was already done and fill in the gaps rather then recreating work 
that has already been completed.

My mind has been racing for a few years now. I make a killing with my 
business for an hour a week or so and then squandering money and time 
for many more hours. I truly am a HalfMadDad(my IRC handle) I would 
really appreciate guidance so that I don't continue to waste time and 
resources.

Thanks

</PRE>
