</I>Hi Vagner

I was hoping to use web builder in the tutorial I had planned tonight so 
I played around with some things today, I just wanted to feedback in 
case it was useful.

I have not been able to set up firefox yet(thanks for the suggestion 
Mauicio ! ) The prebuilt binaries are not working for me. It could be 
because Trisquel runs the linux-libre kernel:
*<A HREF="http://www.fsfla.org/svnwiki/selibre/linux-libre/*">http://www.fsfla.org/svnwiki/selibre/linux-libre/*</A>
compiling firefox from source looks painful, I am hoping to find another 
option.

I posted a question on the Trisquel list and one user has helped out 
quite a bit. He said that Plupload did work with drupal on Trisquel but 
he had to change some settings and he can't remember which now.

He suggested I install quickjava on abrowser. I have gnash installed and 
it tells sites that I have flash installed when I don't. I used 
quickjava to disable flash/gnash and the file upload dialog appeared as 
it should. When I tried to upload a file that worked under Linux Mint, 
it failed. the dialog showed it as undefined.

I will try some other things out and report back.

Thanks
