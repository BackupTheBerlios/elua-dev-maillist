<PRE>I've had a good elua day :)

James has been mentoring me behind the scenes and I am making progress 
preparing for my next tutorials.

I used webBuilder today and I like it very much. Unfortunately it 
doesn't fit in my screencasting setup just yet. I run dual monitors 
here, rotated 90 degrees. I have my screencasting area taped off,  a 
shell script ready to run some commands and so on.

A little while after Ubuntu switched to the Unity desktop I switched to 
Trisquel Linux and I am very happy with it. I can watch youtube and 
don't have any proprietary software on my machine at all(apparently the 
standard Linux Kernel has proprietary blobs now). The Trisquel crowd are 
purists though and have even rebranded Firefox and forked it as the 
firefox project encourages people to load extensions which are closed 
source.

The rebranded browser is called abrowser. When I run webBuilder in it, a 
message quickly flashes that says &quot;your browser doesn't have flash, 
gears, silverlight or html 5 installed&quot;. Then a screen pops up with a 
button that says &quot;play&quot;.

I tried it with Midori, IceCat and Arora on my machine too. On my Wife's 
Mint Linux, it works fine but I am not sure if the mint-flash 
application installed is proprietary and it's not going to be in the 
Trisquel repositories. I am not sure how to check but I am assuming some 
of the browsers on my machine are html 5 equipped, maybe some one could 
tell me how to check for this?

I also tried on Windows  2000 and it did not work but I guess no one 
else is running old versions like this.

Has anyone else been able to get this running on Linux without 
proprietary software?

Thanks for reading-Patrick
