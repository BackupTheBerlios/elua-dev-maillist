</I>
This does sound interesting, and a definite possible solution.  As another
reply stated, I would still like to have semaphores and mutexes to keep
things in line however.

I don't know how much I like having to turn the GC off though.  With it on
Lua can run on a small 64K system very well, with it off things get a little
hairy.  And even with it off things will still be non-deterministic, as when
you do finally get around to calling the GC, you still don't know how long
it will take to run. What happens if an ISR fires during this time that
makes a block of data ready to be processed in Lua? Actually turning it off
may make latencies worse, since it will take longer to run when you do get
around to running it.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Actually it only requires one VM.  The lua thread that is waiting on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> semaphore will block in C land.  No need to interrupt the VM.  Basically it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would be Lanes for eLua with a well defined c-&gt;lua lua-&gt;c API.  At least
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that was my idea anyway. :)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was talking about having to do ISRs from Lua itself. If you just want to
</I>&gt;<i> block in C, you might not need threads at all, just block in a C module and
</I>&gt;<i> let your interrupt handlers do all the work. It's a limited model, still
</I>&gt;<i> pretty usable in my experience. Also in my experience, there are (too) many

</I>&gt;<i> (by &quot;very well&quot; I mean that the added code complexity would not be

</I>&gt;<i> priorities and interrupt nesting, you'd probably go the OS way only for
</I>&gt;<i> quite complex applications (remember that I'm still talking about
</I>&gt;<i> small-to-medium complexity embedded systems here).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Ahh, I would never do an ISR in Lua.  Way too slow.

I agree about rusing to use an OS.  None of the embedded controllers I have
done have used or needed one.  Of course none of them have had a script
language running on them either. :)

Lets not forget that just by adding Lua we in fact *are* increasing the
complexity of the system, by quite a bit.  The whole purpose (in my mind) of
adding something like Lua to an embedded system is to make tasks like UI
creation and such easier, not to replace any of the RT parts.  The easiest
way to connect the non RT domain of Lua to the RT domain is through an OS.
Just having C code running that blocks the Lua code while it waits for a new
piece of data to display is not going to be enough I think.  You still need
some method of synchronization between the ISR and the C code that presents
the data to Lua, else what do you do if the ISR gets called twice (or more)
while the Lua code is waking up?


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for taking care of how the data is passed between the ISR and the VM,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> also see Lanes... ;)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I know about Lanes, it's an excellent package. I didn't look at its code
</I>&gt;<i> though, so I don't know how the data is passed between states. All I
</I>&gt;<i> remember is seeing a relatively large numbers of threads where people
</I>&gt;<i> complain about this stuff on the Lua mailing list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Ahh, I have never actually used it, just looked at the site and the source a
little bit.  To me it basically seemed like a wrapper for pthreads, maybe
its not.

What I would invision for eLua is more along the lines of simple Lua
interfaces to the system provided synchronization primitives, and maybe some
sort of event system where you register callbacks in Lua that get run when
data is available on the C side of things.  This way you would only need one
Lua thread.  An event driven system like glib and Gtk provide is kinda nice.
