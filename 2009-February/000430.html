<PRE>&gt;<i> There are different levels of &quot;open source&quot; out there, ranging from MIT
</I>&gt;<i> (which is probably as liberal as it gets) and going towards GPL (and other
</I>&gt;<i> less known licenses) which is quite restrictive in some contexts.
</I>
Strictly speaking, this is not true. A software license either is
&quot;open source&quot; or it is not. There is a formal definition:

<A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php">http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php</A>

MIT, BSD, GPL and a number of other licenses satisfy this definition.
They are all &quot;open source,&quot; though different kinds. Neither is more
&quot;open source&quot; than the other.

Luminary license, as far as I can see, does not satisfy requirements
#8 and #10 of the definition. So, it's not &quot;open source&quot;. This doesn't
mean it's bad, unreasonable or not &quot;liberal&quot;. But it's not &quot;open
source&quot; per OSI's definition. (It also isn't &quot;free software&quot; per FSF's
definition.)

But what I was trying to say was a little different. It doesn't matter
whether their license specifically allows you to mix their code with
GPL code. The reason it doesn't matter is because GPL already
prohibits you from doing so. If you distribute a mix that includes GPL
code, you must allow your users to run it on any hardware. If you
don't, you will be in violation of GPL. However, you cannot allow them
to do that, because running the mixed software on non-Luminary
hardware is prohibited by the Luminary license. If they removed the
anti-GPL clause from their license, you _still_ wouldn't be able to
mix it with GPL code.
