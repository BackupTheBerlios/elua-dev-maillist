There's no problem with discussing these things though (with some  
limitations) :-)

Even if the lower level APIs don't adopt an object style of notation,  
there were a couple of things that came out there that were  
interesting.  I think that the grouping or atomizing of channels is  
something that may prove to be a very useful feature, which may not  
have been communicated had we not gone down that path.  Also, I  
personally have only started recently working with Lua, so getting  
perspectives how others would want to implement something like this is  
quite valuable.

KISS is a difficult philosophy to adhere to when there are innumerable  
ways to do even simple things.  Given that, I think that brainstorming  
a bit about the different ways to do things can help in figuring out  
what does and doesn't make sense about any given approach.  It also  
should help with preventing cases where someone looks at this, many  
months down the road, and wonders why some particularly braindead  
decision was made :-)

Also, giving good reasons to rip out useless or bizarre functionality  
should help keep this smaller.

All of that said, things do need to be balanced.  We don't want  
something that needs even a megabyte of RAM to run in, so some ideas  
will generally always be off the table :-)
