I hear you, crystal clear. I really came to the list with a very
different point of view and this thread has been a good lesson of
scale and politics for me... :o)

As a side note, it's interesting how &quot;small&quot; is a subjective concept.
For an astronomer, the moon is probably small... for me, something
around 5k was small, but once you find that people are fighting for
bytes suddenly the scale changes.

I apologize for not spending time enough to get a feeling of the
project bias and culture before manifesting my ideas and I promise to
be more careful in the future.

&gt;<i> Let's go for option 3, the one that doesn't use an object notation at all
</I>&gt;<i> (for reasons I mentioned at the beginning of this thread).

Consistency is enough for me too, let's leave the higher level APIs
for those with extra space.

Andr&#233;
