<PRE>&gt;<i> Hmm.. how are you suggesting this be implemented?  Should the module just
</I>&gt;<i> have a setup routine that registers a handler on load, or with some sort of
</I>&gt;<i> init function?  It might be nice to have a C API that abstracts this a
</I>&gt;<i> little to where code changes between platforms are minimized.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Exactly, it's all in the API. I only have the big picture in my head at this
point, no details. In other words, I just know it can be done, but I can't
tell you how right now :)


&gt;<i> Ah, I see two parts to this.  Having dynamically loadable libraries is
</I>&gt;<i> useful, but there are also a number of facilities that would make doing
</I>&gt;<i> RT/IS routines easier.  I think suggesting this sort of behavior as a
</I>&gt;<i> solution makes me lean even more towards having semaphores / mutexes to make
</I>&gt;<i> sure that these ISRs aren't being stepped on, or are stepping on stuff going
</I>&gt;<i> on in Lua.  The other thing that would be highly useful would be queues, or
</I>&gt;<i> something like them since you cannot count on the VM picking up data
</I>&gt;<i> products necessarily at a fixed rate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Of course you're right, you'd need some sort of event queues in this
situation. Semaphores and mutexes would be an welcomed addition.
In the particular case of the ADC, I think you could use the buffering
mechanism from src/buf.c, have you looked at that? Very basic, but it might
be enough for you.


&gt;<i> All of these things certainly should be balanced against flash and RAM
</I>&gt;<i> requirements in terms of whether they are worth it.  I think FreeRTOS and
</I>&gt;<i> ChibiOS are pretty small though in both areas, and even if we didn't go full
</I>&gt;<i> RTOS they might have useful examples for how to implement some of the
</I>&gt;<i> features they provide.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
FreeRTOS is minimal enough as it is, and I _think_ you can even choose not
to compile all its features.


&gt;<i> I think these discussions are interesting.  I've done most of my previous
</I>&gt;<i> microcontroller coding on bare metal with no RTOS.  These discussions, as
</I>&gt;<i> well as working on some implementations are helping me to understand the ins
</I>&gt;<i> and outs of different implementations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I only did RTOSes once or twice (once with the very good uC/OS-II package)
but it was mainly for instructional purposes. I build a few medium
complexity embedded systems, and never felt a real need for an OS. YMMV, of
course :)

Best,
Bogdan
