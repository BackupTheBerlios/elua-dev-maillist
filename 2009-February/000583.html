<PRE>&gt;<i> Is that source redistribution or binary redistribution that is restricted?
</I>&#160;Or is it both?

Their binaries can't be freely redistributed without an agreement. You can
get them from their CDs or download them from their web site, but can't
include them with your application or post them in your web site.

I don't know if their sources can be freely redistributed. They certainly
can't restrict redistribution of the baseline GNU sources because of the
licensing.

One thing they do explicitly allow is downloading their source distribution,
building binaries and redistributing those. Some ARM hardware and software
vendors do this. One restriction is that the resulting binaries can't
include any reference to CodeSourcery (e.g. on --version or elsewhere).
 
&gt;<i> I've heard some good things about them. &#160;Unfortunately there's a pretty
</I>&gt;<i> high price tag associated with using IAR's tools unless you only need 32k.
</I>
University or volunteer projects generally can't justify purchasing
commercial tools. It is difficult to justify paying for tools when you are
not paid for your work. Some commercial projects do justify IAR tools,
particularly those where a smaller code size or reduced debugging time
result in lower project costs. If you do embedded ARM development for a
living, IAR can be worthwhile.

&gt;<i> Do you have any thoughts on the EABI vs non-EABI stuff?
</I>
There are some advantages in EABI. Since the object format is well defined
so you can link and debug libraries built with different compilers. Software
interrupts (swi in assembler) and structure packing are more efficient.
Floating point can be significantly better, even on ARMs without an FPU.
There's a floating point comparison in

  Why ARM's EABI matters

The EABI advantages may not be significant to many eLua projects. But there
is little incentive in staying with ELF. All current ARM compilers (IAR,
Keil, GCC and its derivatives) default to EABI.
