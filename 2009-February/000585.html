<PRE>Replying again to this one, now with the new mindset in place... :o)

After a better look at the examples and the http server, it's clear
that space is a much more high priority than I was assuming. I don't
see how we can beat the current web server+request handler+template
parser implementation under 4K... :o)

&gt;<i> For a WASAPI bind, it seems that we would need a real net.select().
</I>
Not really, but forget WSAPI for now.

&gt;<i> Although we can simulate one with what we have today, this will probably be

</I>
I see no problem with the current implementation, and I think only
after you have more headroom for Lua code you should spent time on
this.

&gt;<i> Orbit and Sputnik seem very promissing for the embedded world too but not
</I>&gt;<i> before we have 1MB+ RAM on our kits. This is already available on some with
</I>&gt;<i> external memory controllers.
</I>
Then let's leave this as an optional path once you have enough
resources. On that case I would suggest checking WSAPI again. But
probably only the common.lua part of it, not even the helper modules.

&gt;<i> The main idea of lhttpd.lua was to show that a web server can be completely
</I>&gt;<i> written in Lua and still perform pretty well. The problems we've had with
</I>&gt;<i> ours show to have come from uIP, not from lhttpd.lua.
</I>
I can imagine that, and I guess the best strategy would be to focus on
the TCP/IP stack first.

&gt;<i> It seems to me (although I would like to hear more from you all) that for
</I>&gt;<i> v0.6 we could:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Change the opening block tag for Lua code in srvr scripts for &lt;% (as used
</I>&gt;<i> in Kepler)
</I>
I don't see how this would make much of a difference. The API
available for LHP files is already totally different from the one
associated with LP files, so there is no point in using the same
syntax. It could even lead to confusion.

&gt;<i> - .lp extension for html files with Lua web scripting code embedded (&lt;% Lua
</I>&gt;<i> code %&gt;
</I>
Ditto.

&gt;<i> - Review the basic syntax of the net module (I'm sure this will trigger a
</I>&gt;<i> loooong discussion on many other features :)
</I>
I still think that you need to have the TCP/IP stack in place before
you start changing things in the upper levels.

Again, I was using the wrong hat. Sorry for the previous noise on the list. :o)

Andr&#233;
