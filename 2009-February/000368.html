<PRE>The eLua platform support for LM3S is based on the Luminary driver library.
Instead of using BSD or another standard license, Luminary imposes a
peculiar restriction that is stated in their source files.

// All rights are reserved.  You may not combine
// this software with &quot;viral&quot; open-source software in order to form a larger
// program.

Although they do allow free redistribution, that wording could restrict the
use of their driver library in some open source software. I am also
concerned with the use of the &quot;viral&quot; word to describe some open source
projects.
 
This has come up with some of my projects but nobody has been concerned
enough to contest it. I have brought this up with Luminary directly but they
don't see a reason for change. According to them, the license was prepared
by their legal staff and is not a restriction as long as you use their
drivers with LMI hardware. Yet that is not what's implied in that statement.

I would like to know the opinion of the eLua developer community on this.
Could that statement impose a restriction in some applications?
 
Regards,
Jesus Alvarez
