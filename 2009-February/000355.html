I agree here.  That said, if it isn't possible to really interrupt the  
VM, you could accomplish this indirectly with semaphores, and have  
handlers in Lua which execute when it next gets a chance to check them.

&gt;<i> Lets not forget that just by adding Lua we in fact *are* increasing

</I>&gt;<i> my mind) of adding something like Lua to an embedded system is to

</I>&gt;<i> the RT parts.  The easiest way to connect the non RT domain of Lua  
</I>&gt;<i> to the RT domain is through an OS.  Just having C code running that  
</I>&gt;<i> blocks the Lua code while it waits for a new piece of data to  
</I>&gt;<i> display is not going to be enough I think.  You still need some  
</I>&gt;<i> method of synchronization between the ISR and the C code that  
</I>&gt;<i> presents the data to Lua, else what do you do if the ISR gets called  
</I>&gt;<i> twice (or more) while the Lua code is waking up?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You queue your data, of course. It's a very reliable way of  
</I>&gt;<i> connecting two pieces of code running at different speeds. If your  
</I>&gt;<i> queue overruns, then you're pretty much out of luck, because your  
</I>&gt;<i> consumer can't consume the data that the producer is queuing fast  
</I>&gt;<i> enough. And in this case, I don't think an OS could help.
</I>&gt;<i> Also, I think I created some confusion when I said &quot;The Lua VM can't  
</I>&gt;<i> be interrupted&quot;, so I'd like to clarify that. What I meant was that  
</I>&gt;<i> you can't interrupt the Lua VM and force it to execute some other  
</I>&gt;<i> code, like you'd do in a very simple implementation of a Lua ISR:  
</I>&gt;<i> the hardware interrupt handler calls a Lua function directly. This  
</I>&gt;<i> is a big problem if the Lua VM instance you're using was already  
</I>&gt;<i> executing some code, and it won't work. But if you interrupt the Lua  
</I>&gt;<i> VM because of an external event (like an interrupt handler that  
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't touch the Lua state at all, think &quot;timer interrupt&quot; or &quot;UART  
</I>&gt;<i> receive interrupt&quot; or anything like this) everything is 100% safe.
</I>
So, is the only way to &quot;interrupt&quot; Lua (without making major changes)  
to use some sort of polling of state (be that register, semaphore, bit  
flag, whatever...) where Lua periodically checks for any pending  
notifications it should pay attention to?

&gt;<i> Of course you're right, you'd need some sort of event queues in this  
</I>&gt;<i> situation. Semaphores and mutexes would be an welcomed addition.
</I>&gt;<i> In the particular case of the ADC, I think you could use the  
</I>&gt;<i> buffering mechanism from src/buf.c, have you looked at that? Very  
</I>&gt;<i> basic, but it might be enough for you.
</I>
I have looked at it, and I think, with some adaptations, I could shift  
some responsibilities from custom buffering code in the adc code to  
general buffering.

One way or another I'll have something fairly feature complete coming  
up soon.
