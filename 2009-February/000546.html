<PRE>Thanks for those links Andre, I will need to do some detailed reading!
Certainly ALua is conceptually similar, and at about the same level of
abstraction to what I'm suggesting. However I thing the concepts I've been
developing make some improvements to the ALua model:

1. The concept of the &quot;engram&quot; or distributed closure packages the messaging
of a function together with the messaging of runtime variables such that the
variables are scoped local to the function at the receiving end. This seems
safer and more flexible than recreating them as global variables.

2. ALua seems to transmit functions as source strings. I am suggesting the
use of &quot;byte codes&quot; (I'll start calling these VM Codes as I am aware that in
Lua they are actually 32 bits!). This avoids the need to hold message
definitions as strings and to compile them more than once. Each time the
message is sent, a new closure is created from the same compiled function. I
would like to marshal tables as VM Codes also, so the message can be fully
decoded using the existing chunk reader. The messages are also (maybe)
shorter this way.

3. The concept of effectively just storing a message as a persistence
mechanism and playing it back when the processor node is restarted. (Didn't
the earliest data stores work by delaying messages?)

4. The concept of using this persistence as the sole application storage
mechanism avoids the need for a general filing system (for saving scripts
anyway) and unifies the runtime messaging architecture with the development
architecture.

I was more familiar with Rings. I do not really see the need for multiple
Lua states in the microcontroller nodes - like with ALua, a single-threaded
queued scheduler implemented in C but calling Lua event handlers seems
adequate as long as the event handlers are kept brief, and coroutines can be
used for heavier processing tasks. On PCs there would be (potentially)
multiple &quot;virtual microcontroller&quot; nodes working exactly the same way - each
node single threaded. This would be a &quot;share nothing&quot;
multiprocessing/threading model and there'd be no problem implementing these
with one OS thread or process per node.

&quot;Pluralitas non est ponenda sine necessitate&quot; indeed... :o)

Are you thinking in something like actor based messaging? Or are you
talking about a lower level of interaction here?

Have you checked Noemi's work with ALua?

You may also want to check Rings if having a way to mix distributed
and local nodes would be interesting. RIngs is for multiple local Lua
states, but the idea could work as a base for distribution:

Finally, me and F&#225;bio have been thinking in a way to sync distributed
repositories using some messaging protocol (maybe XMPP), would it make
sense to try something on this line of thought?
