<PRE>And on a related topic: on the Lua list I've seen some people that want Lua
support on much &quot;lower end&quot; architectures, like 8-bit MCUs. As I see it
right now, the way to go with this is to have a completely rewritten VM
interpreter (probably with lots of restrictions) that would be able to run
on these machines. But I'm curious, how many people would like to have even
a (quite) restricted Lua running on low-to-medium end 8/16-bit MCUs (with
little Flash and RAM resources)?

Best,
Bogdan

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Good or bad?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Good, I think :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There does not seem to be much public info on this chip, yet.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Here is what an Atmel friend wrote (guess this is public, he did not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> state otherwise):
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Would the AT32UC3A be a good alternative for a stamp.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; This has networking on the chip.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Code can be developed using the JTAGICE Mk II, which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I bet is available to many people.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, it turns out that (surprisingly :) ) there aren't that many people
</I>&gt;<i> with access to a JTAGICE. The AVR32 I'm working with has a DFU mode for
</I>&gt;<i> software uploading, I guess they'll keep it in the new chips too, so this is
</I>&gt;<i> fine, cause all you need to program it is an USB cable and the software from
</I>&gt;<i> Atmel (which runs equally well on Windows and Linux).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; We will soon have the AT32UC3A3 with high speed USB
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; as well as SD-Card controller.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Built for MP3. It also has more SRAM (128 kB).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 128k of intermal SRAM is a Very Very Good Thing for eLua :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please say YEAH if you personally are interested.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> YEAH !!!! :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've promised the Atmel guy that we'd craft an Application Note on how
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to use Lua on this chip.  I don't think that's too much to be asked,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and it would further the cause of eLua, anyhow.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sure, this would benefit everybody. I'll write the appnote if we get

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Hi all,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; There was recently a discussion on the Lua list about Lua on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; embedded devices, and thinks got pretty hot (in a good way :) ), so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I invited all the people that wanted to continue that discussion to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; join this list (since the profile of the Lua list suggests that it's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; not the best place to discuss regular hardware). We had more than 10
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; people joining the elua-dev list after this announcement, so I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; expect things to become pretty hot here too :) I'll try to resume
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; the discussions by including the last relevent message from the Lua
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; list (this message is from Mike Panetta):
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; More embedded notes (with some Lua content):
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, the LPC2478 is pretty nice.  My brother was looking at using one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; at work (no Lua, though), but that project is currently on hold.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Somebody will make a Cortex M3 with an external bus.  The NXP LPC17xx
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; series (Cortex M3) looks pretty nice; the LPC1768 has 64K RAM, 512K
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; flash, MAC, USB OTG, 2xCAN, 4xUART, PWM, QEP, etc, but no external
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; bus.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I am willing to bet that either Luminary or ST Micro will be the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; first out the gate with such a design.  In fact ST Micro has a new
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; line of chips on the back burner to release some time this year I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; think, but you have to sign an NDA to see the product map, which I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; have not done so have no clue as to whats there.  I personally think
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; they may be waiting to pop right on the market with available
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; product as soon as Luminary announces what it has up its sleeves.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; They seem to be in a tight heat with each other as far as parts
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; competition goes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I agree its too bad that ST does not have a cortex part with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Ethernet though, as they are the lowest price chip on the market
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; right now with the STM32F103ZET6 (512K Flash, 64K RAM, CAN, USB, 8
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; timers, 4 of which are capable of doing QEI, 2 of which are capable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; of doing motion PWM, 5 U(S)ARTS, 3 SPI, 2 I2C etc etc..... in an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; LQFP144) at $10.25 *IN SINGLES* at AVNET.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I do not think that Luminary can compete with ST on price at the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; moment because of process size (smaller process size means more dice
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; per wafer which means cheaper chips... but you already knew that :)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Thats of course assuming that ST uses a smaller process then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Luminary does (Isn't Luminary Fabless?).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; One thing that has made me pro ST (besides the price) is that ST
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; seems to characterize the power consumption of their chips better
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; then Luminary does.  They also seem to use less power then either
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Luminary or NXP parts at the same clock.  However, that may be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; misleading as the Luminary parts have faster flash in them, so mips/
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; watt may be less in the Luminary parts then in the ST ones when
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; running from Flash, but I have no data to back that up (or dispute
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; it).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; In reality, all the really cool chips are BGA, but those make QFPs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; look easy to prototype.  There are companies selling products that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; claim to make prototyping with SMT parts easier, such as SchmartBoard,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; but I haven't tried them.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; QFP's (and QFN's) *ARE* easy to prototype with, esp if you designed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; the part footprint yourself. QFP's can be soldered in a jiffy with a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; rake soldering technique, and when you get good at it you won't even
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; need to use solder braid to get the shorts out because there won't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; be any. QFN's take a little bit longer (the ones with a thermal pad
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; on the bottom are easier IMO because you can fix them down with it)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; but are also a no brainer.  I designed a powersupply/LIPo charger
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; with an LTC3556 USB power manager chip and hand soldered it. First
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; proto worked perfectly, no bridges or anything.  It took me 2-3 hrs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; to complete the soldering job, all by hand.  My next protos will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; hopefully be done by toaster method, but I need to build a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; controller first.  Its kinda hard to get the parts when your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; unemployed :P
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I personally think that most peoples fears to soldering SMT parts is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; due to them never having tried it.  Before I first started using SMT
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; in my designs I thought the same thing.  One day I just broke down
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; and used some SMT parts on a small design, one that would be ok to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; trash if I fudged it up.  Soldering the board was much much easier
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; then I first thought, even the QFP's! (It was an ATMega128 design).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Since then I have never wanted to go back to through hole parts,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; except for little pieces of free wired 'art' that I have made. :)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Still, ARM MCUs are getting down in size; the STM32F103T8 has 20K RAM,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 64K flash in a 36 pin QFN.  But to run Lua decently, you'll need at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; least a QFP80 (e.g. LPC1758 with 64K, ST STR911FAM4x with 96K SRAM).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; BTW, you always have to read the fine print; for example, in both the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; STR9 and LPC238x, the 96K SRAM is also used for the Ethernet buffers,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; so if you use the network, you won't actually have 96K available.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; So very true.  All of the large ram NXP parts are like that.  They
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; have a 64K main RAM area, and 2 16K buffer/DMA areas for the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Ethernet and USB controllers.  Supposedly you can execute out of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; DMA RAM, but I think some of the parts have eratta related to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; that...  And I would not hold my breath on the NXP Cortex-M3 parts,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; it took over a year between when some of the LPC24xx parts were
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 'released' and when they actually became available to purchase in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; any real quantities.  The LCD parts were the worst I believe, just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; becoming available around 2 months or so ago.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Compilers &amp; DSPs: most DSPs need the manufacturer's compilers (I know
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; TI's do); however, IIRC, the ADI Blackfin DSPs use gcc.  Someday I may
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; try compiling Lua for a TI C6701 board, but that's not going to happen
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; for a while.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; CAN is a 1Mbps network, so there's no way a UART will work.  You can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; add them externally, e.g. via a SPI port.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Meh, UARTS in some chips can go up to 4Mbps now.  I do agree that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; using SPI would be easier though, as Microchip has SPI-&gt;CAN bridge
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; chips available.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Finally, because this bugs me, some terminology notes:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; SoC - System on a Chip.  So, a chip that integrates almost everything
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; a piece of equipment (system) needs.  A good example is a highly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; integrated chip for MP3 players.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; SiP - System on a Package.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; MCU - Microcontroller.  A CPU that includes all its memory on chip.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; MCUs go back to the very early days, with such chips as the Intel
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 8042, before the term SoC was ever used.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; MPU - Microprocessor.  A CPU that needs external memory (e.g. x86,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Atmel AT91RM9200)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; If there really is enough interest, we should start thinking about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; starting a dedicated embedded processor Lua mailing list.  Then we can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; go off topic without fear!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I agree 100%!  I would love to continue this discussion.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
