Hmm.. how are you suggesting this be implemented?  Should the module  
just have a setup routine that registers a handler on load, or with  
some sort of init function?  It might be nice to have a C API that  
abstracts this a little to where code changes between platforms are  
minimized.

Ah, I see two parts to this.  Having dynamically loadable libraries is  
useful, but there are also a number of facilities that would make  
doing RT/IS routines easier.  I think suggesting this sort of behavior  
as a solution makes me lean even more towards having semaphores /  
mutexes to make sure that these ISRs aren't being stepped on, or are  
stepping on stuff going on in Lua.  The other thing that would be  
highly useful would be queues, or something like them since you cannot  
count on the VM picking up data products necessarily at a fixed rate.

This and related issues are on my mind currently because I'm finding I  
have to keep track of a fair amount of state to do all I'm  
implementing with the ADC module.  I don't explicitly need queues or  
semaphores as a system-provided tool, but I could certainly make use  
of them :-)

All of these things certainly should be balanced against flash and RAM  
requirements in terms of whether they are worth it.  I think FreeRTOS  
and ChibiOS are pretty small though in both areas, and even if we  
didn't go full RTOS they might have useful examples for how to  
implement some of the features they provide.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Actually it only requires one VM.  The lua thread that is waiting on

</I>&gt;<i> Basically it would be Lanes for eLua with a well defined c-&gt;lua lua- 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;c API.  At least that was my idea anyway. :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was talking about having to do ISRs from Lua itself. If you just  
</I>&gt;<i> want to block in C, you might not need threads at all, just block in  
</I>&gt;<i> a C module and let your interrupt handlers do all the work. It's a  
</I>&gt;<i> limited model, still pretty usable in my experience. Also in my  
</I>&gt;<i> experience, there are (too) many times when people rush to use an OS  
</I>&gt;<i> when they could do very well without it (by &quot;very well&quot; I mean that  
</I>&gt;<i> the added code complexity would not be significant). If your CPU has  
</I>&gt;<i> a modern interrupt controller that supports priorities and interrupt  
</I>&gt;<i> nesting, you'd probably go the OS way only for quite complex  
</I>&gt;<i> applications (remember that I'm still talking about small-to-medium  
</I>&gt;<i> complexity embedded systems here).
</I>
Right, and while you may not have actuall Lua ISRs you could expose  
functionality to Lua allowing it to control whether interrupts are  
enabled/disabled and what is called when said interrupt fires.  I also  
think some general primitives (queues, semaphores) would be useful as  
Mike describes, although I'm not sure if we need all that Lanes does.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for taking care of how the data is passed between the ISR and the  
</I>&gt;<i> VM, also see Lanes... ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I know about Lanes, it's an excellent package. I didn't look at its  
</I>&gt;<i> code though, so I don't know how the data is passed between states.  
</I>&gt;<i> All I remember is seeing a relatively large numbers of threads where  
</I>&gt;<i> people complain about this stuff on the Lua mailing list.
</I>

I've heard that complaint as well.  The author states that a large  
number of threads are generated through time, but that there are only  
a few that are running at any given time.

I think these discussions are interesting.  I've done most of my  
previous microcontroller coding on bare metal with no RTOS.  These  
discussions, as well as working on some implementations are helping me  
to understand the ins and outs of different implementations.
