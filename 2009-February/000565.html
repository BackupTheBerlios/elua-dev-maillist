</I>
That may be true.  The problem with hypothetical situations is that  
their number is infinite :-)

&gt;<i> You can look at this as something similar to the choices offered by

</I>&gt;<i> the same time if the reading loop is not fast enough to follow the
</I>&gt;<i> event flow. :o)
</I>
Right, although at least we likely don't have to worry about the  
security issues that appear with things coming over TCP/UDP :-)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Timeout can be left for future versions, the point was that the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> constructor uses named parameters, which facilitates extensions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Right.  I'm not exactly sure what the best route is for this now.   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> approach I'm inclined to take for now is to return nil values or  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> similar if there are no pending operations which could provide the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> requested
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> set of samples.  This should be fairly robust for built-in ADCs,  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but might
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have some ugly situations if you had an external ADC that just got  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unplugged
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd suggest returning an empty table when there were no samples and a
</I>&gt;<i> nil+errmsg when there was an error.
</I>
OK, that seems reasonable.  In the latter case we actually return a  
luaL_error, although those are mainly done in cases where buffer  
allocations fail.  For something more recoverable, it seems reasonable  
to complain but not bail out completely.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Here a few use cases would help determining what way to go. I  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> think it
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> may be possible to set timer types (and behaviors) on the  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> constructor,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> but I'd need to understand better your needs.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think this is one of the critical things here.  I know ways in  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would use this personally, and have built in a fair amount of  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> infrastructure
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for that.  The problem is that I can think of innumerable features  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> _could_ be useful in hypothetical situations :-)  It would be nice  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to have a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rundown of common usage scenarios and see how well whatever  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implementation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is chosen fulfills that range.  This would allow us to draw the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> line on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> features.  I'm certainly not aiming to reproduce MATLAB's data  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> acquisition
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> toolbox or anything :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed, but for that a wiki page is better than a mail thread. :o)
</I>
Yeah.  Maybe we should consider that.  I can post some of this up on  
the eLua wiki, so that it is in one place while I'm working on  
implementation and people can make changes when needed.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Well, once you have the API defined, you can call it from both  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> sides.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> It would depend more on which you would prefer.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sorry, what I meant here was that the implementation of the API  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> itself might
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be a mixture of Lua and C.  Looking a bit at some things in PIL  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> though,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> suggest to me that you could still do the module implementation on  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the C
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> side.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Exactly, but that choice usually depends more on system restrictions
</I>&gt;<i> than on style.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OT: Speaking of which I should just break down and get a copy of  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> PIL 2, I'm
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mainly using the online version of the first edition :-)  Is there  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> any way
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to get an electronic version of the second edition or is there just  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> paper version?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No PiL 2 electronic version yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;plug&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> If you decide to get the cellulose version, keep in mind that buying
</I>&gt;<i> it from lua.org or luaforge.net helps each project respectively, it's
</I>&gt;<i> your choice. hehe
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/plug&gt;
</I>
Hmm.. If I had more spare funds, I might do both.  Perhaps I'll go  
with lua.org for now since I've not yet thanked them for such a lovely  
and simple but flexible language :-)

(That said, I also have to say that I'm also a large fan certain  
language written by a Dutch man, who may happen to currently work for  
Google.  Different tools for different situations.  This other  
language could definitely learn a thing or two about VM  
implementation, if not some other things, from Lua.)
