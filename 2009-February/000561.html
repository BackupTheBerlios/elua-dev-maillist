<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>Alright, a word of warning first: I'm not by any means a specialist in ADCs,
and I only used them in a buch of applications. That said, I do have some
ideas about how they work and what they're supposed to do, and a few ideas
of my own about the design of the module itself. The basic principle here is
KISS. I want the modules to cover all the needed functionality, but no more
than that. I definitely don't want a full blown API, but rather to keep
everything as lightweight as possible. For example, you might have noticed
that none of the modules currently exported by eLua use the &quot;object
notation&quot;. This is intentional, as the &quot;standard&quot; notation is still more
widely used in different instances of embedded programming, plus it keeps
the implementation simpler. Of course, keeping a good balance between a
minimal API and a good functionality is an art in itself, something that I
don't pretend to master (but I try anyway :) ).
With that in mind, I think that our current ADC module does enough to
qualify as functional

- single sampling
- multiple sampling at a given frequency (which is very deterministic, being
handled in the backend with interrupts which are quite accurate).
- moving average filtering (quite important in real-life applications).

In the future, once interrupt handlers are implemented in eLua, we'll also
support double buffering, in that we'll have a circular sample buffer, and
an &quot;interrupt&quot; will be fired when that buffer is half full. This would allow
certain kind of applications (like data loggers) to be written very easily.
I think this is a very powerful model.

Please see below my other comment.


Single Function to Request and Return:
&gt;<i> 1. Simple Model
</I>&gt;<i> call function to start sampling
</I>&gt;<i> function waits for sampling to finish
</I>&gt;<i> function returns samples
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Not acceptable if this is the only model, perfectly OK if it coexists with
other (asynchronous) models.\

2. Non-blocking Model (this was present in an earlier version of the ADC
&gt;<i> module)
</I>&gt;<i> call function to start sampling, function returns
</I>&gt;<i> do some other stuff
</I>&gt;<i> call function again to get samples from the sampling period, and start next
</I>&gt;<i> set of sampling
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Interesting, but let's see the next one.

Separate Request &amp; Return Functions:
&gt;<i> 3. Separated Request/Return Model
</I>&gt;<i> call function to start sampling, function returns
</I>&gt;<i> do other work
</I>&gt;<i> use another function to get samples in the buffer (this can be done while
</I>&gt;<i> sampling is still happening)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I assume you're talking about a circular buffer here, and this is perfectly
OK with me. Add an overflow flag for those situations when you don't collect
the samples on time and you're all set (and it also matches (to some extent)
the interrupt model I was talking about earlier. Maybe even add a function
that would return &quot;true&quot; when half (or an user-specified fraction of the
buffer) is full).
This is the kind of funtionality I get from an Advantech acquisition board
on a PC (well, from its library API actually), and it was all I needed to
write a very precise acquisition application that archives data over very
long periods of time, plot real time graphs, thinks like this. I'm sure the
model would work equally well on embedded.

- samples collected in the background, other work can be done while samples
&gt;<i> are collected
</I>&gt;<i> - samples collected using fairly deterministic timer-based interrupt system
</I>&gt;<i> - longer deterministic periods can be used where one can request 100
</I>&gt;<i> samples, but only pull in 5 at a time while sampling is happening, while
</I>&gt;<i> still getting low timing jitter
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
For this situations, it might be a good idea to add a &quot;poll&quot; function that
would return 'true' each time a predefined number of samples (6 in your
example) are available. Kinda like the &quot;return true when half of the buffer
is full&quot; idea, but more generic.

- could be extended to support indefinite periods of sampling with buffer
&gt;<i> wrapping if samples aren't pulled out fast enough, but when you do need
</I>&gt;<i> samples you can pull out up to the length of the buffer and they're still
</I>&gt;<i> pretty well-timed
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Of course you can. You can't escape circular buffers. If your process is
slow enough, it's all you need for continuous acquisition. If it's too fast,
it doesn't matter how long your buffers are, you will get into overflows at
some point.


&gt;<i> - more complicated, including dealing with buffer sizes
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Why is that? We already know how to specify buffer sizes.


&gt;<i> - multiple commands needed to initiate/get samples
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That's not really a problem.
In conclusion, this (3) would be my preffered model, with a catch: let's not
make it more complex than it needs to be.


&gt;<i> One alternative that I've not mentioned here is that there be two
</I>&gt;<i> functional models for getting samples.  If one wants, one could have a
</I>&gt;<i> simple getsamples method that follows model 1, and a second pair that
</I>&gt;<i> follows model 3. i.e.:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> channels = adc.channel(0, 3, 17, 21)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -- Style 1: Simple Blocking Model
</I>&gt;<i> a = channels:getsamples(count)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -- Style 2: Separated Model
</I>&gt;<i> channels:requestsamples(count, timer, frequency)
</I>&gt;<i> channels:returnsamples(count)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Let's go for option 3, the one that doesn't use an object notation at all
(for reasons I mentioned at the beginning of this thread).

Best,
Bogdan
