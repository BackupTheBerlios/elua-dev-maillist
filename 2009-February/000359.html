Thanks, Bogdan, for arranging this and for doing the heavy work on  
eLua itself.

I've asked Atmel to spare us some samples of their upcoming AT32UC3A3  
chip.  Hopefully we get full development kits, but maybe just chips.

Is there anyone else on the list that would have time and interest to  
take up such a package?  I am asking for two, and my thinking is we  
could &quot;shuffle&quot; them among each other as need, interest and available  
time varies. So they would be &quot;jointly&quot; owned by the eLua community.  
Good or bad?

There does not seem to be much public info on this chip, yet.

Here is what an Atmel friend wrote (guess this is public, he did not  
state otherwise):

&gt;<i> Would the AT32UC3A be a good alternative for a stamp.
</I>&gt;<i> This has networking on the chip.
</I>&gt;<i> Code can be developed using the JTAGICE Mk II, which
</I>&gt;<i> I bet is available to many people.
</I>&gt;<i> AVR32 Studio is an Eclipse environment working on both
</I>&gt;<i> Windows &amp; Linux which again is probably appreciated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We will soon have the AT32UC3A3 with high speed USB
</I>&gt;<i> as well as SD-Card controller.
</I>&gt;<i> Built for MP3. It also has more SRAM (128 kB).
</I>&gt;<i> Mid year will be the UC3C which has CAN bus and
</I>&gt;<i> lots of motor control features.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How much code for a LUA interpreter?
</I>&gt;<i> How many chips are needed?
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe we can throw in some dataflashes as well.
</I>
Please say YEAH if you personally are interested.  The RAM is arranged  
in three partitions, one of which is for USB packages. The amount of  
internal RAM should be the main interest for us here, I guess.

I've promised the Atmel guy that we'd craft an Application Note on how  
to use Lua on this chip.  I don't think that's too much to be asked,  
and it would further the cause of eLua, anyhow.

&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There was recently a discussion on the Lua list about Lua on  
</I>&gt;<i> embedded devices, and thinks got pretty hot (in a good way :) ), so  
</I>&gt;<i> I invited all the people that wanted to continue that discussion to  
</I>&gt;<i> join this list (since the profile of the Lua list suggests that it's  
</I>&gt;<i> not the best place to discuss regular hardware). We had more than 10  
</I>&gt;<i> people joining the elua-dev list after this announcement, so I  
</I>&gt;<i> expect things to become pretty hot here too :) I'll try to resume  
</I>&gt;<i> the discussions by including the last relevent message from the Lua  
</I>&gt;<i> list (this message is from Mike Panetta):

</I>&gt;<i> More embedded notes (with some Lua content):

</I>&gt;<i> Yes, the LPC2478 is pretty nice.  My brother was looking at using one
</I>&gt;<i> at work (no Lua, though), but that project is currently on hold.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Somebody will make a Cortex M3 with an external bus.  The NXP LPC17xx

</I>&gt;<i> flash, MAC, USB OTG, 2xCAN, 4xUART, PWM, QEP, etc, but no external
</I>&gt;<i> bus.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am willing to bet that either Luminary or ST Micro will be the  
</I>&gt;<i> first out the gate with such a design.  In fact ST Micro has a new  
</I>&gt;<i> line of chips on the back burner to release some time this year I  
</I>&gt;<i> think, but you have to sign an NDA to see the product map, which I  
</I>&gt;<i> have not done so have no clue as to whats there.  I personally think  
</I>&gt;<i> they may be waiting to pop right on the market with available  
</I>&gt;<i> product as soon as Luminary announces what it has up its sleeves.   
</I>&gt;<i> They seem to be in a tight heat with each other as far as parts  
</I>&gt;<i> competition goes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree its too bad that ST does not have a cortex part with  
</I>&gt;<i> Ethernet though, as they are the lowest price chip on the market  
</I>&gt;<i> right now with the STM32F103ZET6 (512K Flash, 64K RAM, CAN, USB, 8  
</I>&gt;<i> timers, 4 of which are capable of doing QEI, 2 of which are capable  
</I>&gt;<i> of doing motion PWM, 5 U(S)ARTS, 3 SPI, 2 I2C etc etc..... in an  
</I>&gt;<i> LQFP144) at $10.25 *IN SINGLES* at AVNET.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I do not think that Luminary can compete with ST on price at the  
</I>&gt;<i> moment because of process size (smaller process size means more dice  
</I>&gt;<i> per wafer which means cheaper chips... but you already knew that :)   
</I>&gt;<i> Thats of course assuming that ST uses a smaller process then  
</I>&gt;<i> Luminary does (Isn't Luminary Fabless?).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One thing that has made me pro ST (besides the price) is that ST  
</I>&gt;<i> seems to characterize the power consumption of their chips better  
</I>&gt;<i> then Luminary does.  They also seem to use less power then either  
</I>&gt;<i> Luminary or NXP parts at the same clock.  However, that may be  
</I>&gt;<i> misleading as the Luminary parts have faster flash in them, so mips/ 
</I>&gt;<i> watt may be less in the Luminary parts then in the ST ones when  
</I>&gt;<i> running from Flash, but I have no data to back that up (or dispute  
</I>&gt;<i> it).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In reality, all the really cool chips are BGA, but those make QFPs
</I>&gt;<i> look easy to prototype.  There are companies selling products that
</I>&gt;<i> claim to make prototyping with SMT parts easier, such as SchmartBoard,
</I>&gt;<i> but I haven't tried them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> QFP's (and QFN's) *ARE* easy to prototype with, esp if you designed  
</I>&gt;<i> the part footprint yourself. QFP's can be soldered in a jiffy with a  
</I>&gt;<i> rake soldering technique, and when you get good at it you won't even  
</I>&gt;<i> need to use solder braid to get the shorts out because there won't  
</I>&gt;<i> be any. QFN's take a little bit longer (the ones with a thermal pad  
</I>&gt;<i> on the bottom are easier IMO because you can fix them down with it)  
</I>&gt;<i> but are also a no brainer.  I designed a powersupply/LIPo charger  
</I>&gt;<i> with an LTC3556 USB power manager chip and hand soldered it. First  
</I>&gt;<i> proto worked perfectly, no bridges or anything.  It took me 2-3 hrs  
</I>&gt;<i> to complete the soldering job, all by hand.  My next protos will  
</I>&gt;<i> hopefully be done by toaster method, but I need to build a  
</I>&gt;<i> controller first.  Its kinda hard to get the parts when your  
</I>&gt;<i> unemployed :P
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I personally think that most peoples fears to soldering SMT parts is  
</I>&gt;<i> due to them never having tried it.  Before I first started using SMT  
</I>&gt;<i> in my designs I thought the same thing.  One day I just broke down  
</I>&gt;<i> and used some SMT parts on a small design, one that would be ok to  
</I>&gt;<i> trash if I fudged it up.  Soldering the board was much much easier  
</I>&gt;<i> then I first thought, even the QFP's! (It was an ATMega128 design).   
</I>&gt;<i> Since then I have never wanted to go back to through hole parts,  
</I>&gt;<i> except for little pieces of free wired 'art' that I have made. :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Still, ARM MCUs are getting down in size; the STM32F103T8 has 20K RAM,
</I>&gt;<i> 64K flash in a 36 pin QFN.  But to run Lua decently, you'll need at
</I>&gt;<i> least a QFP80 (e.g. LPC1758 with 64K, ST STR911FAM4x with 96K SRAM).
</I>&gt;<i> BTW, you always have to read the fine print; for example, in both the
</I>&gt;<i> STR9 and LPC238x, the 96K SRAM is also used for the Ethernet buffers,
</I>&gt;<i> so if you use the network, you won't actually have 96K available.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So very true.  All of the large ram NXP parts are like that.  They  
</I>&gt;<i> have a 64K main RAM area, and 2 16K buffer/DMA areas for the  
</I>&gt;<i> Ethernet and USB controllers.  Supposedly you can execute out of the  
</I>&gt;<i> DMA RAM, but I think some of the parts have eratta related to  
</I>&gt;<i> that...  And I would not hold my breath on the NXP Cortex-M3 parts,  
</I>&gt;<i> it took over a year between when some of the LPC24xx parts were  
</I>&gt;<i> 'released' and when they actually became available to purchase in  
</I>&gt;<i> any real quantities.  The LCD parts were the worst I believe, just  
</I>&gt;<i> becoming available around 2 months or so ago.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Compilers &amp; DSPs: most DSPs need the manufacturer's compilers (I know
</I>&gt;<i> TI's do); however, IIRC, the ADI Blackfin DSPs use gcc.  Someday I may
</I>&gt;<i> try compiling Lua for a TI C6701 board, but that's not going to happen
</I>&gt;<i> for a while.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> CAN is a 1Mbps network, so there's no way a UART will work.  You can
</I>&gt;<i> add them externally, e.g. via a SPI port.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Meh, UARTS in some chips can go up to 4Mbps now.  I do agree that  
</I>&gt;<i> using SPI would be easier though, as Microchip has SPI-&gt;CAN bridge  
</I>&gt;<i> chips available.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, because this bugs me, some terminology notes:
</I>&gt;<i> SoC - System on a Chip.  So, a chip that integrates almost everything
</I>&gt;<i> a piece of equipment (system) needs.  A good example is a highly
</I>&gt;<i> integrated chip for MP3 players.
</I>&gt;<i> SiP - System on a Package.
</I>&gt;<i> MCU - Microcontroller.  A CPU that includes all its memory on chip.
</I>&gt;<i> MCUs go back to the very early days, with such chips as the Intel
</I>&gt;<i> 8042, before the term SoC was ever used.
</I>&gt;<i> MPU - Microprocessor.  A CPU that needs external memory (e.g. x86,
</I>&gt;<i> Atmel AT91RM9200)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If there really is enough interest, we should start thinking about
</I>&gt;<i> starting a dedicated embedded processor Lua mailing list.  Then we can
</I>&gt;<i> go off topic without fear!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree 100%!  I would love to continue this discussion.
</I>&gt;<i>
