That would be nice. Hmm...

I'd like it to go faster as well.  I haven't tried timing a lot of  
things in elua, so I'm not sure if this corresponds to general  
function call overhead for the VM.

That said, this is one reason why we have burst :-)  I've not pulled  
out a function generator to figure out what the absolute maximum limit  
is for this, but that should achieve or at least get quite near to the  
1Msample/s that the LM hardware is rated for.

I agree, though I'm not sure what the best strategy is here.

As far as avoiding variable sample timing, I would use burst.  It  
should be possible to set the mode to nonblocking, tell burst to  
collect, say, 100 samples, and pull samples from the buffer before it  
has completed the run.

I've not tested this at all, though.  Also, on read the buffer does  
disable interrupts for a very short period of time when the read  
pointers are updated, so this could delay a sample for however many  
instructions it takes to complete that small section.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm pretty sure that most of that 350 us is due to the lua vm and  
</I>&gt;<i> not the underlying C code of the ADC module.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, probably but gc is beeing forced by the adc code.
</I>
At this point I'm not explicitly telling telling the garbage collector  
to do anything.  If it runs it is based on the heuristics built into  
the VM.  I'm not sure what the best strategy would be in terms of  
requesting or preventing garbage collection.

I'm open to comments on this front, for sure :-)
