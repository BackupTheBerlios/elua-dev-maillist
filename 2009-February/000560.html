But assuming that the event or generator is continuous, this could
lead to the program reading really old data, no? Wouldn't this be
somewhat strange since the data flow would tend to be very unrelated
to the real time flow?

You can look at this as something similar to the choices offered by
TCP and UDP. You can offer continuity or real time, but not both at
the same time if the reading loop is not fast enough to follow the
event flow. :o)

&gt;&gt;<i> Timeout can be left for future versions, the point was that the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> constructor uses named parameters, which facilitates extensions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right.  I'm not exactly sure what the best route is for this now.  The
</I>&gt;<i> approach I'm inclined to take for now is to return nil values or something
</I>&gt;<i> similar if there are no pending operations which could provide the requested
</I>&gt;<i> set of samples.  This should be fairly robust for built-in ADCs, but might
</I>&gt;<i> have some ugly situations if you had an external ADC that just got unplugged
</I>&gt;<i> :-)
</I>
I'd suggest returning an empty table when there were no samples and a
nil+errmsg when there was an error.

&gt;&gt;<i> Here a few use cases would help determining what way to go. I think it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> may be possible to set timer types (and behaviors) on the constructor,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but I'd need to understand better your needs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think this is one of the critical things here.  I know ways in which I

</I>&gt;<i> toolbox or anything :-)
</I>
Agreed, but for that a wiki page is better than a mail thread. :o)

&gt;&gt;<i> Well, once you have the API defined, you can call it from both sides.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It would depend more on which you would prefer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry, what I meant here was that the implementation of the API itself might
</I>&gt;<i> be a mixture of Lua and C.  Looking a bit at some things in PIL though,
</I>&gt;<i> suggest to me that you could still do the module implementation on the C
</I>&gt;<i> side.
</I>
Exactly, but that choice usually depends more on system restrictions
than on style.

&gt;<i> OT: Speaking of which I should just break down and get a copy of PIL 2, I'm
</I>&gt;<i> mainly using the online version of the first edition :-)  Is there any way
</I>&gt;<i> to get an electronic version of the second edition or is there just the
</I>&gt;<i> paper version?
</I>
No PiL 2 electronic version yet.

&lt;plug&gt;
If you decide to get the cellulose version, keep in mind that buying
it from lua.org or luaforge.net helps each project respectively, it's
your choice. hehe
&lt;/plug&gt;
