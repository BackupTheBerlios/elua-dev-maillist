<PRE>Hello Alvarez,
   Thank you for bringuing this to the list.
   We've had the same concern before, as the Luminary's Cortex M3 were one
of our first ports.
   Just like you, we went straight to the LM guys and they gave us the same
explanation, that their libs can be freely used, as long as they run on
their hardware.
   I totally agree with you that their use of the term &quot;viral&quot; open-source
software, is at least very bad for their image but aparently they like it
for some reason.
   I still have their answer message (e-mail), although I'm not sure if it
has any legal value. Now that the community has grown (a lot ! :), I may try
to get something more &quot;official&quot; from them. I don't think we will have any
problems here though, as it would be a pitty for their nice ARMs not to have
eLua on them :) :) and also because they have already added us to their 3rd
Party Products Page (
<A HREF="http://www.luminarymicro.com/products/3rd_party_products.html">http://www.luminarymicro.com/products/3rd_party_products.html</A>).
   Thanks again !

Best
Dado
