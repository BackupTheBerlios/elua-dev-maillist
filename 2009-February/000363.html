<PRE>Hi everyone! I am one of the aforementioned refugees from the Lua list, in
fact I think it was my posting that got everyone talking about
microcontrollers and LuaChips again. I was about to launch my own LuaChip
project as a search had revealed nothing existing except the pbLua port to
the Lego controller, then Bogdan pointed me to the whole existing world of
eLua - not sure if eLua is especially low key or if my search abilities need
honing!

I'd like to help in any way towards a target of getting something like the
Arduino infrastructure, but based on Lua, 32bit and network capability,
available to purchase. This means that for a few tens of dollars I could buy
a small pre-built card that I can plug into a PC (Windows, Linux and perhaps
OSX) via USB and immediately start programming in Lua. The processor needs
to come with the system pre-loaded, or at least an automatic boot loader
which installs it on first connection (and updates as necessary). The card
needs to have connections at breadboard pitch and/or feasible for hand
soldering. Like the Arduino the whole thing including the hardware designs
should be open-source, but the real key is the availability of pre-built
modules that can be used without a C tool chain, special development
hardware or surface-mount assembly tools. Accepting that we have to supply
(or get partners to supply) a board-level product means we can access the
best chips for the job be they surface-mount or even BGA and it also makes
possible a modest revenue stream to help fund the project. (Self-publish
manuals following the Lua.org pattern are another possibility here).

As for a name, does the Portugese word &quot;apara&quot; work in this context? Can it
mean this kind of chip? It sounds well in English, evoking the word
&quot;apparatus&quot;, and it would be nice not to be saddled with an ugly
mixed-language hybrid like &quot;LuaChip&quot;. On the other hand, going all English,
&quot;MoonChip&quot; has a nice ring to it also.

Just some initial thoughts to introduce myself!
