<PRE>&gt;<i> What happens if an ISR fires during this time that makes a block of data
</I>&gt;<i> ready to be processed in Lua? Actually turning it off may make latencies
</I>&gt;<i> worse, since it will take longer to run when you do get around to running
</I>&gt;<i> it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
For sure. The idea was to turn the GC off, and keep it off. This is why I
mentioned &quot;if you have enough RAM&quot;. You probably couldn't do much with only
64k.


&gt;<i> Ahh, I would never do an ISR in Lua.  Way too slow.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It depends actually. If all you need is to have an interrupt firing when you
push an external button, a Lua ISR would be probably more than enough for
your needs. If you need to filter a signal from the ADC ... well ... :)


&gt;<i> Lets not forget that just by adding Lua we in fact *are* increasing the
</I>&gt;<i> complexity of the system, by quite a bit.  The whole purpose (in my mind) of
</I>&gt;<i> adding something like Lua to an embedded system is to make tasks like UI
</I>&gt;<i> creation and such easier, not to replace any of the RT parts.  The easiest
</I>&gt;<i> way to connect the non RT domain of Lua to the RT domain is through an OS.
</I>&gt;<i> Just having C code running that blocks the Lua code while it waits for a new
</I>&gt;<i> piece of data to display is not going to be enough I think.  You still need
</I>&gt;<i> some method of synchronization between the ISR and the C code that presents
</I>&gt;<i> the data to Lua, else what do you do if the ISR gets called twice (or more)
</I>&gt;<i> while the Lua code is waking up?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You queue your data, of course. It's a very reliable way of connecting two
pieces of code running at different speeds. If your queue overruns, then
you're pretty much out of luck, because your consumer can't consume the data
that the producer is queuing fast enough. And in this case, I don't think an
OS could help.
Also, I think I created some confusion when I said &quot;The Lua VM can't be
interrupted&quot;, so I'd like to clarify that. What I meant was that you can't
interrupt the Lua VM and force it to execute some other code, like you'd do
in a very simple implementation of a Lua ISR: the hardware interrupt handler
calls a Lua function directly. This is a big problem if the Lua VM instance
you're using was already executing some code, and it won't work. But if you
interrupt the Lua VM because of an external event (like an interrupt handler
that doesn't touch the Lua state at all, think &quot;timer interrupt&quot; or &quot;UART
receive interrupt&quot; or anything like this) everything is 100% safe.


&gt;<i> What I would invision for eLua is more along the lines of simple Lua
</I>&gt;<i> interfaces to the system provided synchronization primitives, and maybe some
</I>&gt;<i> sort of event system where you register callbacks in Lua that get run when
</I>&gt;<i> data is available on the C side of things.  This way you would only need one
</I>&gt;<i> Lua thread.  An event driven system like glib and Gtk provide is kinda nice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Once Lua ISRs are implemented, we'll see if we really need this or not. I
really don't know what to think at this point.

Best,
Bogdan
