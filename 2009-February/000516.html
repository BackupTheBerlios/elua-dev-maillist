Ah, I get it now.  I think I misunderstood before.  I wasn't thinking  
in terms of nesting tables.

This still has the same issue with making new tables each time the  
function is called, which Bogdan was referencing.  If I use this  
approach in adcscope it takes around 510 us per cycle (4 channels).

each time I do an assignment as follows:

adcvals[i] = adc.getsamples(v,1)

I displace the table at adcvals[i], and put a new one in its place.   
This old table has to be garbage collected.  If we turn off, then  
we'll run out of memory as we continuously sample.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But you still get a spray of tables coming out of the function that  
</I>&gt;<i> GC has to clean up (AFAIK, but I could be wrong).  This approach  
</I>&gt;<i> runs at about 430 us per cycle if 4 channels are having samples  
</I>&gt;<i> requested and pulled out of the buffer in this fashion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right.  GC can be tamed but RAM is still a precious good in the  
</I>&gt;<i> current MCUs.
</I>&gt;<i> I think we should try to move more functionality to the C level.
</I>&gt;<i> But I really need to stop and take a more carefull look on the whole  
</I>&gt;<i> adc API.  It seems too complex for simple (single channel, non  
</I>&gt;<i> filtered, ....) sampling and we need to make it more &quot;generic&quot; too.
</I>
It certainly could be simpler, but there are tradeoffs.  I plan to  
have a version that will work without buffering, so that you can just  
do simple single sample, single channel acquisition (it still would  
require issuing both adc.sample and adc.getsamples, though).  This  
could be switched at compile time.

As far as being generic is concerned, I think everything that's in  
there is easily portable to any of the other architectures that have  
ADC.  The only platform-specific functions that are needed are the  
interrupt handler to put things in the buffer, a function to stop  
burst mode, and the functions for setting up sample and burst.

If you mean in the sense of the API and whatnot, that may be the  
case.  Ideas are welcome :-)
