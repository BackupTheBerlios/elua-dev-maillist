<PRE>&gt;<i> Hi everyone! I am one of the aforementioned refugees from the Lua list, in
</I>&gt;<i> fact I think it was my posting that got everyone talking about
</I>&gt;<i> microcontrollers and LuaChips again.
</I>

Indeed it was, thanks for that :)


&gt;<i> I was about to launch my own LuaChip
</I>&gt;<i> project as a search had revealed nothing existing except the pbLua port to
</I>&gt;<i> the Lego controller, then Bogdan pointed me to the whole existing world of
</I>&gt;<i> eLua - not sure if eLua is especially low key or if my search abilities
</I>&gt;<i> need
</I>&gt;<i> honing!
</I>

Googling for &quot;lua microcontroller&quot; returns eLua on the first page. &quot;lua
embedded&quot; doesn't, as the traditional semantics of that is to embed the Lua
interpreter in other programs, in order to use it as a scripting engine. Not
sure if this is the fault of eluaproject.net or not, I'm not good at all
when it comes to SEO.


&gt;<i> I'd like to help in any way towards a target of getting something like the
</I>&gt;<i> Arduino infrastructure, but based on Lua, 32bit and network capability,
</I>&gt;<i> available to purchase. This means that for a few tens of dollars I could
</I>&gt;<i> buy
</I>&gt;<i> a small pre-built card that I can plug into a PC (Windows, Linux and
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> OSX) via USB and immediately start programming in Lua. The processor needs
</I>&gt;<i> to come with the system pre-loaded, or at least an automatic boot loader
</I>&gt;<i> which installs it on first connection (and updates as necessary). The card
</I>&gt;<i> needs to have connections at breadboard pitch and/or feasible for hand
</I>&gt;<i> soldering. Like the Arduino the whole thing including the hardware designs
</I>&gt;<i> should be open-source, but the real key is the availability of pre-built
</I>&gt;<i> modules that can be used without a C tool chain, special development
</I>&gt;<i> hardware or surface-mount assembly tools. Accepting that we have to supply
</I>&gt;<i> (or get partners to supply) a board-level product means we can access the
</I>&gt;<i> best chips for the job be they surface-mount or even BGA and it also makes
</I>&gt;<i> possible a modest revenue stream to help fund the project. (Self-publish
</I>&gt;<i> manuals following the Lua.org pattern are another possibility here).
</I>

Where are you from? I'm from Romania, and here doing BGA is almost
impossible, as there are few PCB design and assembly companies, and none of
them seem to have the capabilities required for a BGA design to work
(micro-vias, even double sided component soldering, things like this). I'm
actually very curious to know how (if?) this is different in other
countries, especially US.
In my view, the best form factor would be a stamp (hence the LuaStamp I've
been picturing in my head for a while now), i.e. a board as small as
possible, with headers that would allow access to as much MCU pins as
possible. Something like
<A HREF="http://www.luminarymicro.com/products/lm3s8962_can_ethernet_evaluation_kit.html,">http://www.luminarymicro.com/products/lm3s8962_can_ethernet_evaluation_kit.html,</A>
only (hopefully) smaller, and maybe with few connectors mounted on the stamp
itself, but definitely with the USB to RS232 support circuitry on board and
connected to one of the CPU's UARTs, so it would be perfectly possible to
run eLua using only the stamp board. From here there are different ways to
go:

- a &quot;daughter board&quot; that would expose other interfaces (USB, Ethernet, CAN,
other UARTs...)
- an &quot;expansion board&quot; that would allow other boards to be plugged in and
used by the stamp directly (like uCdimm, Microchip's PICTail boards, and I'm
sure there are other similar ideas out there).
- lots of boards that would allow the stamp itself to be stacked with them
vertically (and of course allowing more than two boards to be stacked with a
stamp at a given time).
- probably other things that I can't think of right now.

I think we gain a lot of flexibility by using this approach.
All of this, of course, should be accompanied by a very good support
package. I have many things in mind for this support package, but this in an
idea for a different topic on this list.

As for a name, does the Portugese word &quot;apara&quot; work in this context? Can it
&gt;<i> mean this kind of chip? It sounds well in English, evoking the word
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;apparatus&quot;, and it would be nice not to be saddled with an ugly
</I>&gt;<i> mixed-language hybrid like &quot;LuaChip&quot;. On the other hand, going all English,
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;MoonChip&quot; has a nice ring to it also.
</I>

I'll stick with my &quot;LuaStamp&quot; for now :)

Best,
Bogdan
