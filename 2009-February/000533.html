I wouldn't claim that so fast... let's see how things go first... :o)

&gt;<i>    We do not plan to embedd a full fancy web server like Xavante (Kepler's

</I>
I don't think Xavante would be a good option for eLua. Although
Xavante has proved to be an excellent web server for certain
applications, eLua needs something more &quot;fire and forget&quot; and Xavante
needs some caring if it is supposed to be left running for long
periods.

The thing is that Xavante uses coroutines to allow multitasking
without needing separate threads. While this is great for a developer
setup and embedding into applications, it may not be the best solution
for devices that need to be on &quot;forever&quot; for example. If one of the
requests hang, the other also get stuck. Not a good scenario if you
can't reset easily the server... :o)

If you have the ability to run threads, then any C level webserver
would probably be a better fit. The other solution would be to set a
watchdog for Xavante, but I really would not recommend that for eLua.

Note that the choice of web server has zero impact in the upper layers
due to a decoupling layer called WSAPI. Once you have WSAPI
implemented for a certain web server or launching method (CGI, FastCGI
etc) you are basically done. Everything else depends mostly on WSAPI
to run.

Implementing WSAPI for a webserver is usually quite easy. WSAPI is
basically a protocol that normalizes how to read data from the
webserver (the request) and how to send it back (the response). More
details on WSAPI can be found here:
<A HREF="http://wsapi.luaforge.net/">http://wsapi.luaforge.net/</A>

Once you have WSAPI in place, you actually can start developing web
applications using wsapi.request and wsapi.response. While this is
considered &quot;low level&quot;, it could be enough for most of eLua needs.

If you need something higher level, there are two imediate options.
The first would be using CGILua, a PHP like library that handles Lua
Pages and Lua Scripts:
<A HREF="http://www.keplerproject.org/cgilua/">http://www.keplerproject.org/cgilua/</A>

The other would be using Orbit, a MVC based library that offers some
very nice abstractions:
<A HREF="http://orbit.luaforge.net/">http://orbit.luaforge.net/</A>

Note that there is no easy answer as which would be better for every
case. One simple solution would be to integrate WSAPI with the
embedded web server and then let CGILua and Orbit as options for those
who needed it.

Once you have one of the page generator solutions in place, you can
start using higher level applications for them. One excellent
candidate would be Sputnik, that uses only WSAPI.

Sputnik is usually seen as just another wiki, but it is way more than
that. It is basically an hierarchical node store with versioning. If
that is truly useful for eLua applications or not is another
question... :o)

Sorry if the mail got too long.
