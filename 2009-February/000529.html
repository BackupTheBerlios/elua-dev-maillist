<PRE>Hi Dado,

Yes, I am simply amazed at how much you manage to fit into 200MB odd - all
the Lua builds I've done (for x86) have come out around twice that, and that
is using the FS and network stack in the OS. These ARM processors must be
very code-efficient!

I had not thought of this system as requiring a file system at all - just a
basic ability to read/write flash at a physical address. Certainly it would
not do for some apps such as web servers or media players, but it could be
enough for many control and instrumentation apps. A full file system could
then be an option for apps requiring it. An off-line GC / simple compacter
should be adequate to cope with deletions in this scenario. Of course, there
needs to be some way to build the userdata proxies in RAM at startup, but a
simple walk of the chain of persisted functions should suffice here (and the
same walk could process the &quot;autorun&quot; flags).

The set of ideas I am groping towards here is about getting to an embedded
development system that targets a network of processing nodes (physical and
virtual on a PC) rather than a single node. The key concept is &quot;portable
code&quot; or moving code around the network in &quot;byte code&quot; format. The basic
unit stored or moved round the network is the &quot;engram&quot; which is essentially
a serialised or marshalled closure (function in dump format plus runtime
values like upvalues). Each node has a simple scheduler which runs engrams
as they arrive over the network, on time schedules or in response to
hardware interrupts on the microcontroller. There is no &quot;main&quot; program, the
application consists entirely of event responses (scheduled engrams).

Functionality is mapped as follows:

- Application loading: Send some engrams to the node which create and
persist other engrams.
- Data persistence: Persist engrams and auto-load them on startup.
- Messaging: Send an engram from one node to another whence it gets
executed, possibly sending a response engram back.
- Realtime: Run engrams according to a schedule or on hardware interrupts.
- Multiprocessing: See Messaging!

I am still thinking these ideas through, but I do have a feeling that there
is maybe the possibility of doing something elegantly simple and yet getting
a lot of power (like with Lua itself). As a countryman of mine once said
(back in the time when educated Englishmen still spoke Latin) &quot;Non sunt
multiplicanda entia praeter necessitate&quot;.
