<PRE>OK, let me try to explain this half-thought-out idea a bit more clearly! I
feel a &quot;hello world&quot; coming on!

 

Starting with an empty LuaStamp, I load something like the following into
its RAM:

 

app = flash(function() print(&quot;hello world&quot;) end, &quot;autorun&quot;)

app()

 

This will print (whatever that means in this context) &quot;hello world&quot;
immediately.

 

Now I cycle the power on the controller and it powers up and prints &quot;hello
world&quot; again.

 

The new &quot;flash&quot; library function takes a function and does a string.dump
operation on it saving the resulting byte code string in flash memory along
with an initial &quot;flags&quot; byte which in this case has the &quot;autorun&quot; flag set.
&quot;flash&quot; returns a userdata (app) containing the address of the string in
flash memory and having a metatable with a _call metafunction defined.

 

The final line of the original chunk calls the app userdata, invoking the
_call metafunction which loadstring's the function from flash and tail-calls
it. (More complexly the userdata might point to the original function cached
in RAM for performance reasons at this stage). This step could be omitted, I
just put it in to show what is going on.

 

Now we turn power off, killing the original chunk and any cached copy of the
function.

 

When we power up again, the system looks through the part of the flash
memory used to store functions. It sees the persisted version of our
function and that it's &quot;autorun&quot; flag is set. So it loadstring's it from
flash, re-creates the userdata proxy and executes it printing &quot;hello world&quot;
again.

 

In a more complex scenario, the autorun function might create whole library
tables of userdata &quot;function proxies&quot;  pointing to additional functions in
flash which are not autorun. These get loaded into RAM when they are first
called, and may be flushed at any time to conserve RAM.

The discussion of the eLua file system and autoruns is very interesting.
Sorry if this goes over old ground but I have not actually started working
with eLua yet (planning to start with the next release - I'm waiting to see
which hardware to buy!)


Currently, the LM3S CPU has the most features implemented for eLua. This
might or might not hold true in the future, I can't give any guarantees on
this.
 

One idea I had when I was working on this on my own was to dispense with a
file system altogether and use persistence instead. You would load source
code over a network or serial link into a RAM buffer and compile it from 

eLua can already upload code into RAM via XMODEM. Not exactly what you
meant, but a good start :) 

there. Then there would be a feature added to Lua to back functions in
tables off into flash memory in dump (byte-code) format. The value in the
table would be replaced by a userdata containing a pointer into the flash. A
__call metamethod on the userdata would recover the function into RAM
whenever it was called (this could be a caching system so it would be
retained in RAM until flushed). Alternatively, the runtime could be modified
to execute the function in flash. There could be some flags on each function
dumped to flash including a &quot;run at boot&quot; flag. On boot, the system would
search the flash function store and run any functions with this flag set.

I'm not sure I understood this, can you give a simple example (maybe
together with an equally simple usage scenario)? I just can't grasp the
concept apparently :) 

Sorry again if I've just re-invented the wheel!

I don't think you did; on the contrary, you probably came up with something
new that I'm just unable to understand yet :)

Best,
Bogdan
