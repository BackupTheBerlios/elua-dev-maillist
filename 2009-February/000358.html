<PRE>Hi all,

There was recently a discussion on the Lua list about Lua on embedded
devices, and thinks got pretty hot (in a good way :) ), so I invited all the
people that wanted to continue that discussion to join this list (since the
profile of the Lua list suggests that it's not the best place to discuss
regular hardware). We had more than 10 people joining the elua-dev list
after this announcement, so I expect things to become pretty hot here too :)
I'll try to resume the discussions by including the last relevent message
from the Lua list (this message is from Mike Panetta):

</I>

I am willing to bet that either Luminary or ST Micro will be the first out
the gate with such a design.  In fact ST Micro has a new line of chips on
the back burner to release some time this year I think, but you have to sign
an NDA to see the product map, which I have not done so have no clue as to
whats there.  I personally think they may be waiting to pop right on the
market with available product as soon as Luminary announces what it has up
its sleeves.  They seem to be in a tight heat with each other as far as
parts competition goes.

I agree its too bad that ST does not have a cortex part with Ethernet
though, as they are the lowest price chip on the market right now with the
STM32F103ZET6 (512K Flash, 64K RAM, CAN, USB, 8 timers, 4 of which are
capable of doing QEI, 2 of which are capable of doing motion PWM, 5
U(S)ARTS, 3 SPI, 2 I2C etc etc..... in an LQFP144) at $10.25 *IN SINGLES* at
AVNET.

I do not think that Luminary can compete with ST on price at the moment
because of process size (smaller process size means more dice per wafer
which means cheaper chips... but you already knew that :)  Thats of course
assuming that ST uses a smaller process then Luminary does (Isn't Luminary
Fabless?).

One thing that has made me pro ST (besides the price) is that ST seems to
characterize the power consumption of their chips better then Luminary
does.  They also seem to use less power then either Luminary or NXP parts at
the same clock.  However, that may be misleading as the Luminary parts have
faster flash in them, so mips/watt may be less in the Luminary parts then in
the ST ones when running from Flash, but I have no data to back that up (or
dispute it).


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In reality, all the really cool chips are BGA, but those make QFPs
</I>&gt;<i> look easy to prototype.  There are companies selling products that
</I>&gt;<i> claim to make prototyping with SMT parts easier, such as SchmartBoard,
</I>&gt;<i> but I haven't tried them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
QFP's (and QFN's) *ARE* easy to prototype with, esp if you designed the part
footprint yourself. QFP's can be soldered in a jiffy with a rake soldering
technique, and when you get good at it you won't even need to use solder
braid to get the shorts out because there won't be any. QFN's take a little
bit longer (the ones with a thermal pad on the bottom are easier IMO because
you can fix them down with it) but are also a no brainer.  I designed a
powersupply/LIPo charger with an LTC3556 USB power manager chip and hand
soldered it. First proto worked perfectly, no bridges or anything.  It took
me 2-3 hrs to complete the soldering job, all by hand.  My next protos will
hopefully be done by toaster method, but I need to build a controller
first.  Its kinda hard to get the parts when your unemployed :P

I personally think that most peoples fears to soldering SMT parts is due to
them never having tried it.  Before I first started using SMT in my designs
I thought the same thing.  One day I just broke down and used some SMT parts
on a small design, one that would be ok to trash if I fudged it up.
Soldering the board was much much easier then I first thought, even the
QFP's! (It was an ATMega128 design).  Since then I have never wanted to go
back to through hole parts, except for little pieces of free wired 'art'
that I have made. :)


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Still, ARM MCUs are getting down in size; the STM32F103T8 has 20K RAM,
</I>&gt;<i> 64K flash in a 36 pin QFN.  But to run Lua decently, you'll need at
</I>&gt;<i> least a QFP80 (e.g. LPC1758 with 64K, ST STR911FAM4x with 96K SRAM).
</I>&gt;<i> BTW, you always have to read the fine print; for example, in both the
</I>&gt;<i> STR9 and LPC238x, the 96K SRAM is also used for the Ethernet buffers,
</I>&gt;<i> so if you use the network, you won't actually have 96K available.
</I>

So very true.  All of the large ram NXP parts are like that.  They have a
64K main RAM area, and 2 16K buffer/DMA areas for the Ethernet and USB
controllers.  Supposedly you can execute out of the DMA RAM, but I think
some of the parts have eratta related to that...  And I would not hold my
breath on the NXP Cortex-M3 parts, it took over a year between when some of
the LPC24xx parts were 'released' and when they actually became available to
purchase in any real quantities.  The LCD parts were the worst I believe,
just becoming available around 2 months or so ago.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Compilers &amp; DSPs: most DSPs need the manufacturer's compilers (I know
</I>&gt;<i> TI's do); however, IIRC, the ADI Blackfin DSPs use gcc.  Someday I may
</I>&gt;<i> try compiling Lua for a TI C6701 board, but that's not going to happen
</I>&gt;<i> for a while.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> CAN is a 1Mbps network, so there's no way a UART will work.  You can
</I>&gt;<i> add them externally, e.g. via a SPI port.
</I>

Meh, UARTS in some chips can go up to 4Mbps now.  I do agree that using SPI
would be easier though, as Microchip has SPI-&gt;CAN bridge chips available.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, because this bugs me, some terminology notes:
</I>&gt;<i> SoC - System on a Chip.  So, a chip that integrates almost everything
</I>&gt;<i> a piece of equipment (system) needs.  A good example is a highly
</I>&gt;<i> integrated chip for MP3 players.
</I>&gt;<i> SiP - System on a Package.
</I>&gt;<i> MCU - Microcontroller.  A CPU that includes all its memory on chip.
</I>&gt;<i> MCUs go back to the very early days, with such chips as the Intel
</I>&gt;<i> 8042, before the term SoC was ever used.
</I>&gt;<i> MPU - Microprocessor.  A CPU that needs external memory (e.g. x86,
</I>&gt;<i> Atmel AT91RM9200)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If there really is enough interest, we should start thinking about
</I>&gt;<i> starting a dedicated embedded processor Lua mailing list.  Then we can
</I>&gt;<i> go off topic without fear!
</I>

I agree 100%!  I would love to continue this discussion.
