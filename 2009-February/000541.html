</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Assuming this terminology, the proposed API could be slightly changed
</I>&gt;<i> so instead of having channels as the first order objects, we have
</I>&gt;<i> samplers now. In this scenario channels are just numbers again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> s1 = adc.sampler(1)
</I>&gt;<i> others = adc.sampler(3, 4, 6) -- no channel 21 this time hehehe
</I>
I like this concept.  Especially because it somewhat mirrors how the  
hardware is implemented on LM boards.

I also like it because it makes for a nice conceptual way to think  
about grouping channels.  Channels act as sources individual sources,  
which pool into a given sampler.  The sampler then has additional  
properties such as when samples are collected, how many, etc..

This will make the backend somewhat more complicated, but it should  
all be doable.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Your proposed style 1 could be used like this, where the sampler
</I>&gt;<i> blocks, reads 10 samples at the rate of 1000/s and returns
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -- defines the sampler mode and do the one time initialization you  
</I>&gt;<i> need
</I>&gt;<i> s1:setmode{asyn = false, rate=100, buffer=10}
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> while cond do
</I>&gt;<i>   mybuffer = s1:read() -- only reads, no initialization
</I>&gt;<i>   dosomething(mybuffer)
</I>&gt;<i> end
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note here that the buffer defined is in fact used to pre allocate
</I>&gt;<i> space for each read. If you need to vary the number of samples read,
</I>&gt;<i> just pass this number to s1:read(), but this may generate some timing
</I>&gt;<i> issues.
</I>
OK, I like that.

One modification is that we would have to pass a timer number to  
setmode as well, because eLua doesn't have any resource management  
system that abstracts this away.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Your proposed style 2 could be used as this, where the samplers don't
</I>&gt;<i> block and you cand decide how much to pull from the buffers at any
</I>&gt;<i> time:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> s1:setmode{rate = 300, buffer = 1000} -- asyn is true by default
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> s1:start() -- starts background sampling
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> while cond do
</I>&gt;<i>   mybuffer = s1:read(5) -- pulls 5 samples from the buffer
</I>&gt;<i>   dosomething(mybuffer)
</I>&gt;<i> end
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> s1:stop()
</I>
I like this too.

One interesting thing here is what to do if a user calls start when  
asyn=false. Under your model would you propose that it return an error?

I suppose you could use the start method with asyn=false for a fixed- 
length pre-collection of samples before read?  If this were done  
though, perhaps the expectation would be that as soon as you had  
cleared out samples, it would fill things up again?

If asyn is false, does this mean:  Samples will only be collected when  
read is called, and they will be returned via read?
vs the following (asyn = true): Sampling is never initiated by read,  
read can only pull out samples that are in the buffer or arriving in  
the buffer?



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Apparently the differences between the second option and the third are
</I>&gt;<i> mostly related to flexibility and buffer types.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Buffer types could be defined in the setmode() function. For example
</I>&gt;<i> we could use buffertype=&quot;circular&quot; (probably the default) or some
</I>&gt;<i> other type.
</I>
Right, I think this relates to what I was saying above.  You could  
have a circular buffer that wraps around when full, or one that fills  
and then stops until more space is available.

In this respect, you could describe a circular or linear buffer as  
controlling whether or not once you start sampling it will stop at the  
end of the buffer, or be free-running.

Hmm...

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the same way, if you need to specify more sampler parameters, just
</I>&gt;<i> add them to the sampler() constructor.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You may want to consider adding a timeout parameter too, for the case
</I>&gt;<i> where you want to read 10 samples but the buffer contains less than
</I>&gt;<i> that.
</I>
This is a good idea.  At the moment there is no timeout, but I think  
this might get complicated unless we say make a dedicated virtual  
timer or something.

The whole timer usage issue is one of the reasons why we have a simple  
sample function, and then a burst function.  One needs a timer (burst,  
for evenly spaced samples lower than running at the max rate), the  
other just samples whenever called.

One other thing is that it sounds as if this module will end up being  
a mixture of a C interface, and some lua code to handle sampler  
instances? If this is the case, then both the C interface and the end- 
user interface might be rather different-looking...
