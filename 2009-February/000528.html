I'd go with this last suggestion, but let me check if I'm following you.

Apparently you need a way to define channels, samplers and consumers.
A sampler collects data from a channel and may or not buffer it for
future use. A consumer asks for samples from the sampler, possibly in
an asynchronous mode.

Assuming this terminology, the proposed API could be slightly changed
so instead of having channels as the first order objects, we have
samplers now. In this scenario channels are just numbers again.

s1 = adc.sampler(1)
others = adc.sampler(3, 4, 6) -- no channel 21 this time hehehe

Your proposed style 1 could be used like this, where the sampler
blocks, reads 10 samples at the rate of 1000/s and returns

-- defines the sampler mode and do the one time initialization you need
s1:setmode{asyn = false, rate=100, buffer=10}

while cond do
   mybuffer = s1:read() -- only reads, no initialization
   dosomething(mybuffer)
end

Note here that the buffer defined is in fact used to pre allocate
space for each read. If you need to vary the number of samples read,
just pass this number to s1:read(), but this may generate some timing
issues.

Your proposed style 2 could be used as this, where the samplers don't
block and you cand decide how much to pull from the buffers at any
time:

s1:setmode{rate = 300, buffer = 1000} -- asyn is true by default

s1:start() -- starts background sampling
...
while cond do
   mybuffer = s1:read(5) -- pulls 5 samples from the buffer
   dosomething(mybuffer)
end
...
s1:stop()

Apparently the differences between the second option and the third are
mostly related to flexibility and buffer types.

Buffer types could be defined in the setmode() function. For example
we could use buffertype=&quot;circular&quot; (probably the default) or some
other type.

In the same way, if you need to specify more sampler parameters, just
add them to the sampler() constructor.

You may want to consider adding a timeout parameter too, for the case
where you want to read 10 samples but the buffer contains less than
that.

Andr&#233;
