</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please see below my other comment.

</I>&gt;<i> Single Function to Request and Return:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not acceptable if this is the only model, perfectly OK if it

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Interesting, but let's see the next one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Separate Request &amp; Return Functions:
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Separated Request/Return Model
</I>&gt;<i> call function to start sampling, function returns
</I>&gt;<i> do other work
</I>&gt;<i> use another function to get samples in the buffer (this can be done  
</I>&gt;<i> while sampling is still happening)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I assume you're talking about a circular buffer here, and this is  
</I>&gt;<i> perfectly OK with me. Add an overflow flag for those situations when  
</I>&gt;<i> you don't collect the samples on time and you're all set (and it

</I>&gt;<i> about earlier. Maybe even add a function that would return &quot;true&quot;  
</I>&gt;<i> when half (or an user-specified fraction of the buffer) is full).
</I>
This is, by far, the most common model I've seen for a lot of higher  
level APIs (initiate sampling, samples buffer, pull samples out with  
another function).  As an example, since I've worked with it before,  
and the docs are online, here's an overview of how MATLAB deals with  
the wide range of  ADC/DAC/GPIO devices it talks to:
<A HREF="http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/toolbox/daq/index.html?/access/helpdesk/help/toolbox/daq/f14-17602.html&amp;http://www.mathworks.com/products/daq/">http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/toolbox/daq/index.html?/access/helpdesk/help/toolbox/daq/f14-17602.html&amp;http://www.mathworks.com/products/daq/</A>

An overflow flag would be a good idea.  The partial filling flag is  
interesting as well.  Currently we've got a function that will return  
the number of samples available, so adding something to poll for a  
specified number would be trivial.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is the kind of funtionality I get from an Advantech acquisition  
</I>&gt;<i> board on a PC (well, from its library API actually), and it was all  
</I>&gt;<i> I needed to write a very precise acquisition application that  
</I>&gt;<i> archives data over very long periods of time, plot real time graphs,  
</I>&gt;<i> thinks like this. I'm sure the model would work equally well on  
</I>&gt;<i> embedded.
</I>
Do you mean the flag/partial filling mechanism, or the two function  
request/return model?  I'd be interested in hearing some general usage  
case information from your application so that I can keep that in mind  
while doing the implementation.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - samples collected in the background, other work can be done while  
</I>&gt;<i> samples are collected
</I>&gt;<i> - samples collected using fairly deterministic timer-based interrupt  
</I>&gt;<i> system
</I>&gt;<i> - longer deterministic periods can be used where one can request 100  
</I>&gt;<i> samples, but only pull in 5 at a time while sampling is happening,  
</I>&gt;<i> while still getting low timing jitter
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For this situations, it might be a good idea to add a &quot;poll&quot;  
</I>&gt;<i> function that would return 'true' each time a predefined number of  
</I>&gt;<i> samples (6 in your example) are available. Kinda like the &quot;return  
</I>&gt;<i> true when half of the buffer is full&quot; idea, but more generic.
</I>
Right, I was actually thinking of implementing the &quot;half-full&quot; thing  
this way anyways.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - could be extended to support indefinite periods of sampling with  
</I>&gt;<i> buffer wrapping if samples aren't pulled out fast enough, but when  
</I>&gt;<i> you do need samples you can pull out up to the length of the buffer  
</I>&gt;<i> and they're still pretty well-timed
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course you can. You can't escape circular buffers. If your  
</I>&gt;<i> process is slow enough, it's all you need for continuous  
</I>&gt;<i> acquisition. If it's too fast, it doesn't matter how long your  
</I>&gt;<i> buffers are, you will get into overflows at some point.
</I>
Right. Honestly to make it run continuously all I have to do is turn  
off the function that tells the sequencer to stop once the number of  
requested samples are collected.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - more complicated, including dealing with buffer sizes
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why is that? We already know how to specify buffer sizes.
</I>
I didn't mean much more complicated :-)  The complication here, at  
least in terms of the way I'm thinking is if we want to minimize  
buffer size as much as possible but be flexible if more samples are  
coming in and we want to grow the buffer without destroying  
uncollected samples.  I know this isn't essential, though :-) Right  
now, buffers can be resized whenever all samples are pulled out, or  
when a request is made that exceeds current buffer size (any samples  
remaining in the buffer at these times will get nuked though).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - multiple commands needed to initiate/get samples
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's not really a problem.
</I>&gt;<i> In conclusion, this (3) would be my preffered model, with a catch:  
</I>&gt;<i> let's not make it more complex than it needs to be.
</I>
Right, I'd be open to suggestions of where to pare things down.  But  
before I do that, here are a few things that people have brought up or  
have come up that might be useful to consider:

1. Have a function that returns only one sample at a time from the  
buffer (if available). Depending on whether we keep the &quot;amend/adjust  
the table&quot; approach, this does make it so that if all I want is one  
sample, I can do that without the overhead of creating a new table.   
This could also be a function that could request the sample itself as  
well.

2. Locking multiple channels to a clock was discussed during the  
object model discourse, so that one could have a bunch of channels  
grab each sample in lock step.  Doing this without the object model is  
less attractive, but I could see doing something like the following:

adc.chain(0,3,8)

Where any property modification or sampling request you make of one is  
made of all of them, so if I then do:

adc.setsmoothing(0,16)

it is actually equivalent to:

adc.setsmoothing(0,16)
adc.setsmoothing(3,16)
adc.setsmoothing(8,16)

but more importantly, when I do adc.sample(0)

they all fire off conversions sequentially on the C side where the  
delay between conversions would be much more minimal than doing a loop  
in lua.  I think I would keep the reads from each channel separate  
though (not return all channels' results with one adc.getsamples(),  
though that could be done too)

If you do the same for burst requests, they all get triggered by the  
same clock.

If the idea of chaining seems a little unsavory, since it could make  
code hard to interpret later if you miss the chaining command, we  
could also accept a table of channel_ids as opposed to just single  
channel ids for at least burst and sample.  So you might call  
something like this:

adc.burst({0, 3},16,0,5000)

this would initiate sampling on channels 0 and 3 to collect 16  
samples, using timer 0, at 5000 Hz...

That doesn't even require a new function :-)

3. Do we keep the modify-the-table approach? I think having number 1  
above that returns single samples at least removes this need for  
something that samples like adcscope.lua does.

Table modification is a bit ugly in the API, but it could be done in a  
limited fashion.  Either only appending could be allowed, or going  
slightly more flexible, modifications could be made starting at an  
offset, but only if the number of elements to modify were included.  I  
think of this as sort a syntactically ugly version of using slices  
(like in Python) to modify data :-)

Or, we can just return new tables for now :-)  Any thoughts about what  
to do in the immediate future with this?  We could have global tables  
to represent returned samples, but I don't like that a huge amount.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One alternative that I've not mentioned here is that there be two  
</I>&gt;<i> functional models for getting samples.  If one wants, one could have  
</I>&gt;<i> a simple getsamples method that follows model 1, and a second pair  
</I>&gt;<i> that follows model 3. i.e.:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> channels = adc.channel(0, 3, 17, 21)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -- Style 1: Simple Blocking Model
</I>&gt;<i> a = channels:getsamples(count)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -- Style 2: Separated Model
</I>&gt;<i> channels:requestsamples(count, timer, frequency)
</I>&gt;<i> channels:returnsamples(count)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let's go for option 3, the one that doesn't use an object notation  
</I>&gt;<i> at all (for reasons I mentioned at the beginning of this thread).
</I>
I do like the syntax of the object model approach, but consistency is  
a pretty good argument.  The other thing is that if one wanted to, one  
could certainly build a lua-only object model implementation on top of  
the simple API. :-)

Best.
