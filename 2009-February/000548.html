Would this be closer to Erlang then?

</I>
Sure, this makes a lot of sense. My mention of ALua was more as a
reference of previous work, not as a direction per se.

&gt;<i> 3. The concept of effectively just storing a message as a persistence
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism and playing it back when the processor node is restarted. (Didn't
</I>&gt;<i> the earliest data stores work by delaying messages?)
</I>
This is really interesting, and it could eventually be used to restore
node state for hot swapped processors. Not an easy task depending on
the playback history... :o)

&gt;<i> 4. The concept of using this persistence as the sole application storage
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism avoids the need for a general filing system (for saving scripts
</I>&gt;<i> anyway) and unifies the runtime messaging architecture with the development
</I>&gt;<i> architecture.
</I>
I agree, nice.

&gt;<i> I was more familiar with Rings. I do not really see the need for multiple
</I>&gt;<i> Lua states in the microcontroller nodes - like with ALua, a single-threaded
</I>&gt;<i> queued scheduler implemented in C but calling Lua event handlers seems
</I>&gt;<i> adequate as long as the event handlers are kept brief, and coroutines can be
</I>&gt;<i> used for heavier processing tasks. On PCs there would be (potentially)
</I>&gt;<i> multiple &quot;virtual microcontroller&quot; nodes working exactly the same way - each
</I>&gt;<i> node single threaded. This would be a &quot;share nothing&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> multiprocessing/threading model and there'd be no problem implementing these
</I>&gt;<i> with one OS thread or process per node.
</I>
True, and that's why I asked about Erlang up there. :o)

Andr&#233;
