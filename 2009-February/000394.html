<PRE>I agree - making boards up to double-sided plate-through is very easy with
free software and online services like PCBTrain and PCB-Pool, even economic
in single units. Still more difficult to assemble surface-mount components
though unless you have special equipment or very good eyesight and steady
hands! Still batches of a few dozen including assembly can be had
economically.

Well, I think designing and building a modern PCB has become easier - -I'm
on my fourth PCB already (simple stuff for work) and I'm a software guy --
thanks to the modern proto PCB companies.  But maybe partly that's a silicon
valley viewpoint.  But the fact is, for anything remotely high speed, you
really have to make a PCB.  BGAs, however, are a still different matter; for
one, you really need an X-ray system to inspect the boards after assembly.

If a Stamp board is simple, it should be easy to use on a solderless
breadboard for experimenting.

I think a variety of eLua boards would be a good thing.  My interests run
heavily towards industrial automation, which is different from hobby
robotics (I've done a couple jobs using industrial robots, too).  BTW, for
advanced motor controls, TI's DSPs are worth checking out, because in
additional to features like hardware floating point (on the F283xx), TI has
a lot of available motion control code (a lot more than anybody else).

Great to hear that Dean !
   In our very informal &quot;backyard market research&quot;, we've found that a stamp
is not completely welcome to hobbyst, educational teams and prototypers if
it does not come with a base board to plug it in.
   It usually raises the cost (compared to evaluation/demo kits) but it has
the advantage that the stamp can later be used in a final product.
   The thing seems to be: &quot;avoid forcing final users to build PCBs&quot;. They
(here) are not too much against of adding hardware to a board (breadboard
areas, prototyping standard boards, ....) but to design and build modern
PCBs has become a barrier for many.
