No problem.

&gt;<i> One interesting thing here is what to do if a user calls start when
</I>&gt;<i> asyn=false. Under your model would you propose that it return an error?
</I>
I wouldn't mind having both start() and stop() being equivalent to NOP
when asyn=false, but that depends on how user friendly you want to be
to programmers... :o)

&gt;<i> I suppose you could use the start method with asyn=false for a fixed-length

</I>&gt;<i> the expectation would be that as soon as you had cleared out samples, it
</I>&gt;<i> would fill things up again?
</I>
I'm afraid this could be confusing. The proposed start() and stop()
just do that. From the programmer point of view, all the reading
happens on the read() part.

&gt;<i> If asyn is false, does this mean:  Samples will only be collected when read
</I>&gt;<i> is called, and they will be returned via read?
</I>
Well, that seems reasonable for me since we are talking about a
synchronous read. But I may be missing some timing details here.

&gt;<i> vs the following (asyn = true): Sampling is never initiated by read, read
</I>&gt;<i> can only pull out samples that are in the buffer or arriving in the buffer?
</I>
Exactly. Iniatilization and termination would be delegated to start()
and stop(), no matter the asyn mode.

Again, let me know if this violate some timing requirement.

&gt;<i> Right, I think this relates to what I was saying above.  You could have a
</I>&gt;<i> circular buffer that wraps around when full, or one that fills and then
</I>&gt;<i> stops until more space is available.
</I>
Exactly.

&gt;<i> In this respect, you could describe a circular or linear buffer as
</I>&gt;<i> controlling whether or not once you start sampling it will stop at the end
</I>&gt;<i> of the buffer, or be free-running.
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm...
</I>
Call me naive, but I'm not seeing the problem with this approach.
Would you mind giving more details?

&gt;<i> This is a good idea.  At the moment there is no timeout, but I think this
</I>&gt;<i> might get complicated unless we say make a dedicated virtual timer or
</I>&gt;<i> something.
</I>
Timeout can be left for future versions, the point was that the
constructor uses named parameters, which facilitates extensions.

&gt;<i> The whole timer usage issue is one of the reasons why we have a simple
</I>&gt;<i> sample function, and then a burst function.  One needs a timer (burst, for
</I>&gt;<i> evenly spaced samples lower than running at the max rate), the other just
</I>&gt;<i> samples whenever called.
</I>
Here a few use cases would help determining what way to go. I think it
may be possible to set timer types (and behaviors) on the constructor,
but I'd need to understand better your needs.

&gt;<i> One other thing is that it sounds as if this module will end up being a
</I>&gt;<i> mixture of a C interface, and some lua code to handle sampler instances? If
</I>&gt;<i> this is the case, then both the C interface and the end-user interface might
</I>&gt;<i> be rather different-looking...
</I>
Well, once you have the API defined, you can call it from both sides.
It would depend more on which you would prefer.

Andr&#233;
