</I>
OK, fair enough.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If asyn is false, does this mean:  Samples will only be collected  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when read
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is called, and they will be returned via read?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, that seems reasonable for me since we are talking about a
</I>&gt;<i> synchronous read. But I may be missing some timing details here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> vs the following (asyn = true): Sampling is never initiated by  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> read, read
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can only pull out samples that are in the buffer or arriving in the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> buffer?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Exactly. Iniatilization and termination would be delegated to start()
</I>&gt;<i> and stop(), no matter the asyn mode.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, let me know if this violate some timing requirement.
</I>
No violations, I just wanted to make sure that I was understanding the  
intent correctly :-)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Right, I think this relates to what I was saying above.  You could  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> circular buffer that wraps around when full, or one that fills and  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stops until more space is available.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Exactly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In this respect, you could describe a circular or linear buffer as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> controlling whether or not once you start sampling it will stop at  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the end
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of the buffer, or be free-running.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hmm...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Call me naive, but I'm not seeing the problem with this approach.
</I>&gt;<i> Would you mind giving more details?
</I>
I didn't mean to imply that there was a problem with this part of the  
approach.  I think this would be useful for situations where you know  
you want to collect samples about an event, but you're not sure if  
you'd necessarily pick up the results before a ring implementation  
might result in samples being overwritten.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is a good idea.  At the moment there is no timeout, but I  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> might get complicated unless we say make a dedicated virtual timer or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Timeout can be left for future versions, the point was that the
</I>&gt;<i> constructor uses named parameters, which facilitates extensions.
</I>
Right.  I'm not exactly sure what the best route is for this now.  The  
approach I'm inclined to take for now is to return nil values or  
something similar if there are no pending operations which could  
provide the requested set of samples.  This should be fairly robust  
for built-in ADCs, but might have some ugly situations if you had an  
external ADC that just got unplugged :-)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The whole timer usage issue is one of the reasons why we have a  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simple
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sample function, and then a burst function.  One needs a timer  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (burst, for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> evenly spaced samples lower than running at the max rate), the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> other just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> samples whenever called.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here a few use cases would help determining what way to go. I think it
</I>&gt;<i> may be possible to set timer types (and behaviors) on the constructor,
</I>&gt;<i> but I'd need to understand better your needs.
</I>
I think this is one of the critical things here.  I know ways in which  
I would use this personally, and have built in a fair amount of  
infrastructure for that.  The problem is that I can think of  
innumerable features that _could_ be useful in hypothetical  
situations :-)  It would be nice to have a rundown of common usage  
scenarios and see how well whatever implementation is chosen fulfills  
that range.  This would allow us to draw the line on features.  I'm  
certainly not aiming to reproduce MATLAB's data acquisition toolbox or  
anything :-)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One other thing is that it sounds as if this module will end up  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> being a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mixture of a C interface, and some lua code to handle sampler  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> instances? If
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this is the case, then both the C interface and the end-user  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interface might
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be rather different-looking...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, once you have the API defined, you can call it from both sides.
</I>&gt;<i> It would depend more on which you would prefer.
</I>
Sorry, what I meant here was that the implementation of the API itself  
might be a mixture of Lua and C.  Looking a bit at some things in PIL  
though, suggest to me that you could still do the module  
implementation on the C side.

OT: Speaking of which I should just break down and get a copy of PIL  
2, I'm mainly using the online version of the first edition :-)  Is  
there any way to get an electronic version of the second edition or is  
there just the paper version?
