<PRE>&gt;<i> I am willing to bet that either Luminary or ST Micro will be the first out
</I>&gt;<i> the gate with such a design.  In fact ST Micro has a new line of chips on
</I>&gt;<i> the back burner to release some time this year I think, but you have to sign
</I>&gt;<i> an NDA to see the product map, which I have not done so have no clue as to
</I>&gt;<i> whats there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The same thing happened to me with Luminary; they acknowledge the plans for
Cortex MCUs with external memory bus, but they want an NDA to be signed if
you want more details. I tried that, but couldn't get my hands on the NDA
for some reason. In any case, the future does indeed look promising with
these Cortex MCUs.

I personally think that most peoples fears to soldering SMT parts is due to
&gt;<i> them never having tried it.  Before I first started using SMT in my designs
</I>&gt;<i> I thought the same thing.  One day I just broke down and used some SMT parts
</I>&gt;<i> on a small design, one that would be ok to trash if I fudged it up.
</I>&gt;<i> Soldering the board was much much easier then I first thought, even the
</I>&gt;<i> QFP's! (It was an ATMega128 design).  Since then I have never wanted to go
</I>&gt;<i> back to through hole parts, except for little pieces of free wired 'art'
</I>&gt;<i> that I have made. :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You're one of the lucky ones, I never seem to get along with QFPs properly.
But I probably just need a bit more training :)


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Still, ARM MCUs are getting down in size; the STM32F103T8 has 20K RAM,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 64K flash in a 36 pin QFN.  But to run Lua decently, you'll need at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> least a QFP80 (e.g. LPC1758 with 64K, ST STR911FAM4x with 96K SRAM).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> BTW, you always have to read the fine print; for example, in both the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> STR9 and LPC238x, the 96K SRAM is also used for the Ethernet buffers,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so if you use the network, you won't actually have 96K available.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Wow. I knew about the Cortex parts from NXP, just didn't expect to see them
on the market so fast (well, not exactly on the market, since nobody seems
to stock them, but I bet they're getting there). LPC17xx operates at 100MHz,
something that can certainly gain my respect :) and I'm sure things will
only get better from this point.


&gt;<i> So very true.  All of the large ram NXP parts are like that.  They have a
</I>&gt;<i> 64K main RAM area, and 2 16K buffer/DMA areas for the Ethernet and USB
</I>&gt;<i> controllers.  Supposedly you can execute out of the DMA RAM, but I think
</I>&gt;<i> some of the parts have eratta related to that...  And I would not hold my
</I>&gt;<i> breath on the NXP Cortex-M3 parts, it took over a year between when some of
</I>&gt;<i> the LPC24xx parts were 'released' and when they actually became available to
</I>&gt;<i> purchase in any real quantities.  The LCD parts were the worst I believe,
</I>&gt;<i> just becoming available around 2 months or so ago.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This is sad, but Atmel (for example) has problems that are even worse IMO,
since some of their products are virtually impossible to find. Try buying
certain models of AVR32 chips; basically there aren't stocked anywhere, and
the factory lead time period is huge. Same thing for AT91SAM parts with 512k
of Flash and 128k of RAM, I found it almost impossible to get them.

I agree 100%!  I would love to continue this discussion.


So, people ... what would be your ideal MPU for an open source eLua stamp?
Right now, my money (sort of speaking :) ) is with the STR912FAW44 chip from
ST (<A HREF="http://www.st.com/mcu/devicedocs-STR912FAW44.html">http://www.st.com/mcu/devicedocs-STR912FAW44.html</A>). Why is that?

- ARM9 architecture core (the huge majority of ARM-based MCUs out there are
ARM7) that can be clocked at 96MHz (which, needless to say, is Very Good).
- 512k Flash / 96k RAM internal (which is plenty)
- external memory interface ((P)SRAM, not SDRAM, which is good enough).
- Ethernet/USB/CAN besides the &quot;usual&quot; interfaces
- very flexible, software selectable peripheral-to-pin assignment
- very small package (important for a stamp): LQFP128 at 14x14mm (although
this means a pin pitch less than 0.5mm, but someone more skilled than me
could probably solder it instantly :) ).

This preference will probably change if a Cortex core with both external
memory and built-in Ethernet (preferably the built-in Ethernet from
Luminary, cause that includes both MAC AND PHY on-chip) appears on the
market, but until then this is my chip of choice. Ideally the PCB would
include space for an external memory (probably SRAM, since PSRAM comes only
in BGA packages, which adds a lot to the manufacturing complexity) that
would be _optionally_ equipped with an external SRAM (up to 1Mbyte SRAM,
that should be quite enough, although we might stop at 512kbyte or even
256kbyte for most applications).

Allright, let's see what you got now :)

Best,
Bogdan
