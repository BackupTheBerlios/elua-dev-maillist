<PRE>Hi Renaud
   I've updated your patch to svn head and we've tested it on an EVK1100.
It says:
eLua#
lua /rom/dataflash.lua
Press CTRL+Z to exit
Lua

JEDEC Manufacturer ID :         31

This single patch seems to do several separate things:

- add EKV1101 (and the at32uc3a0256 CPU part)
- introduce a mechanism for having several avr32 boards, each with its
pwn separate platform_conf.h file (in EVK1100/evk1100_conf.h etc)
- add SPI for AVR32
- add romfs/dataflash.lua script
- fix a bug in existing flash size calculation for EVK1100:

+++ src/platform/avr32/at32uc3a0512.ld  (working copy)
@@ -1,7 +1,7 @@
 MEMORY
 {
     sram (W!RX) : ORIGIN = 0x00000004, LENGTH = 0x0000FFFC
-    flash (RX) : ORIGIN = 0x80002000, LENGTH = 0x00080000
+    flash (RX) : ORIGIN = 0x80002000, LENGTH = 0x00080000 - 0x2000
 }

Lastly, the code in spi.c and spi.h is obviously a derivative of the
Atmel code in
&quot;ATMEL AVR32-SoftwareFramework-AT32UC3-1.6.1 Release&quot; but the
copyright boilerplate has been removed from the start of their file. I
don't know what elua's copyright strategy is, but I attach the
original notice in case eLua wants to keep it, maybe in a modified
form.

Thanks again for these patches, which make my work much easier to complete.
