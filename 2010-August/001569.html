If you're asking whether one can live without Flash on their machine,
the answer is probably 'yes'. &#160;Apple has sold millions of iPod
Touches, iPhones, and iPads, none of which use Flash. &#160;I use the
Firefox FlashBlock addon, and only occasionally choose to enable it.
The swfupload project (<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/swfupload/">http://code.google.com/p/swfupload/</A>) wraps the
uploader in Javascript to enable a fallback mechanism if the Flash
doesn't run, and the gmail attachment uploader offers a settings page
which can be configured to use either Flash or the HTML uploader.&#160;&#160; If
we could duplicate this fall-back functionality, I think that would be
acceptable to all.

I'll probably whitelist the web builder, but I'd rather not see us
dependent on Flash&#160; for a number of reasons:
&#160;- It's a security hole. Flash security problems allow more control
over the user's computer (Webcam? Microphone?) than other programs
which need security patches.
&#160;- It's a buggy program.&#160; I experience crashes more often due to the
Flash plugin than for any other reason.
&#160;- It's a bandwidth hog.&#160; An HTML based uploader would load the page
faster, put less stress on your servers (which should be optimized for
the build process) and take less space on my limited internet
connection. Also, flash ads.
&#160;- It's a CPU/memory hog.&#160;&#160; Hopefully this is not an issue for the
little upload script, but playing fullscreen video in Flash takes more
system resources than  any alternative video options I've used.
&#160;- It's a black box.&#160; Enough said.

I respect your choice to provide Flash based services, but I hope you
understand that users may choose not to use them.  I too hope that
this can remain a &quot;nice discussion.&quot;
