I guess one question is, how monolithic is SWIG and its language modules?  I
presume they don't just work like plugins and that with the current
implementation you'd end up having to maintain a patch against SWIG unless
it gets integrated?

Is there any way with SWIG to make some of the interface generation
optional? I.e.: to kindof make the Lua support &quot;flavors&quot; of Lua? Or, does it
pretty much have to generate code that would be compatible with both from a
given interface file?  If SWIG doesn't have this as a feature, I wonder
whether this might be useful for them?  We are getting into an age where
languages have multiple implementations (Python, Ruby, Lua among others..),
sometimes these implementations will have differing native C APIs I think as
well?

I'm not sure how much of your work might translate to other tools since I've
not implemented a language with SWIG before or delved into its inner
workings.  There are some other Lua binding generators out there, like tolua
(<A HREF="http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/~celes/tolua/">http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/~celes/tolua/</A>) which appears to be written in
C and have similar functionality to what SWIG does.  There's also
LuaNativeObjects (<A HREF="https://github.com/Neopallium/LuaNativeObjects">https://github.com/Neopallium/LuaNativeObjects</A>) which is
written in Lua.

On the one hand it might be nice to be able to use something like SWIG which
is a mature, well maintained project, but on the other hand.. if we're
adding dependencies to our build system, it's also nice if we can implement
it in pure Lua so that we don't actually have to add an external dependency.
 We also _do_ have a newer build system that Bogdan has worked on
implemented in Lua that potentially something like this could be integrated
into, since part of what we'd like to do there is auto-generate the
platform_conf.h and move some of what we have in C preprocessor into Lua.


(P.S.: Sometimes Dave Beazley comes to the Python user group meetings where
I am so if you need me to bug him about anything in person... :-) )
