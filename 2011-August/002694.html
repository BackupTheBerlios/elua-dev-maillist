<PRE>Hello list,
   We are glad to announce that, starting last Friday, the new site
structure and &quot;look&quot; has become the official eLua project web site.

www.eluaproject.net

   The old site will still be available at <A HREF="http://old.eluaproject.net">http://old.eluaproject.net</A>
We'll add a link to it on the new site soon too.
   The temporary URI new.eluaproject.net will soon be &quot;deactivated&quot; (at
least until we have a reason to upgrade to a new site again :)
   The main/top menu of (almost) all our current services were integrated,
so users can easily navigate among the main site, the wiki, the web builder,
the tracker and the code repo. If anyone knows how to integrate a custom
menu to the code repo site @Github, any help will be appreciated.
   We count on the community for revisions, refinements, fixes and
suggestions in general. There is still a lot of work to do (and somehow this
only seems to grow) but we hope the new tools and general structure will
make it easier for all of us.

   The new site is the result of a collaborative effort. The following is an
incomplete list of contributors, as in fact everyone of you helped with
loose comments on the list or privately in other topics too.
   We are very thankful to all of you and we hope this will move us some
steps ahead.

- The new site structure was initially proposed with Mauricio Bomfim and
Vagner Nascimento and later refined with the help from and brainstorming
with Thiago Naves. Marcelo Politzer, St&#233;phane Beaurin and A&#233;cio Pires..
- The RefineryCMS installation (@Heroku) and configuration, as well as the
Ruby scripts for some services (Quotes, News, Paypal integration and
others....) were done by Vagner Nascimento and Mauricio Bomfim.
- The main site art was produced by Vagner Nascimento and a professional Web
Designer, Diego Jovanholi, sponsored by Raul Nunes (from PUC-Rio but at his
own expenses).
- The templates to reproduce the main new art for the Tracker (Redmine) and
for the Wiki (MoinMoin) were created, programmed and installed by Aecio
Pires.
- The templates to reproduce the main art for the Web Builder were done by
Vagner Nascimento and Carlos Eduardo Deodoro.
- The refactoring of the doc building Lua scripts were done with Vagner
Nascimento and Guilherme Pacheco.
- The VMs, general hosting and backup infra-structure (currently @RDC
PUC-Rio but soon to be moved elsewhere) were installed and are maintained by
Ricardo Rosa.
- In all of the steps above, we had a lot of help and support from James
Snyder and Bogdan Marinescu.

Thank you very much for all the help and a special thanks for those
mentioned above. We wish we could do more and faster and maybe one day this
will be possible.
