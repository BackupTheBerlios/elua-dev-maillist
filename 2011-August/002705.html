</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; OK.  So something like:

</I>&gt;<i> the documentation, so a beginner isn't immediately worried about
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;what's this extra radix thing that it might return&quot; and only power
</I>&gt;<i> users need to deal with funny radices.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yeah, I'm trying to think of use cases where returning the radix would be
essential, and the only things I think think of are situations where you
wanted to feed the value to something else, but selected the radix in
another scope (maybe like a coroutine or a closure, but you could divide by
the radix before returning, or return both in an ad-hoc manner, so I guess
that's not needed.  I just liked the idea that the result could be
interpreted unambiguously without access to the scope in which the
parameters were passed.

So, count that as a &quot;I guess we don't need it&quot;


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I'm ambivalent about adding radix to frequencies for higher-precision
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; low frequencies. It would be nice.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Does one need the christmas lights to flash at 0.43 Hz?  I dunno.  PWM
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can be used for triggering other things like, for example an external
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ADC where that might be useful?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; freq, radix = pwm.setfreq(id, freq, [radix=1])
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK. apart from returning radix again
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For setting the clocking frequency, I don't think there's a good
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reason (pwm.setclock).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Question: do we leave setup for now?  Do we provide radix functionality
</I>&gt;<i> with it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK, let's think about this. If we split into setfreq() and setduty():
</I>&gt;<i> - what does it do when they have set a frequency but not set a duty cycle
</I>&gt;<i> yet?
</I>&gt;<i> - What does it do if they set a duty cycle but haven't set a frequency yet?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Good question. Going based on other peripherals, like if you just &quot;start&quot; a
timer and possibly even pwm currently, it will start going, but the
parameters you haven't set aren't guaranteed.  You get either the default of
the hardware or some default that we selected to initialize the hardware.
 This is a little less than ideal, perhaps we could standardize this a
little more across platforms.. hmm..


&gt;<i> The platform code I have seen for the current pwm.setup() always goes:
</I>&gt;<i> {
</I>&gt;<i>   set pwm period in the hardware, calculated from the requested
</I>&gt;<i> frequency and clock rate;
</I>&gt;<i>   set duty cycle as a period in clock ticks calculated from the pwm period;
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe for this reason it is handy always to have the frequency and
</I>&gt;<i> duty cycle on hand at the same time. However, from the platform code
</I>&gt;<i> I've seen, when setting the duty cycle separately, you can fish the
</I>&gt;<i> period (that you need for the calculation) back out of the hardware
</I>&gt;<i> register.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yeah, generally those registers are readable, I think we often use this in
order to return what things were actually set to.

In a worst case scenario there could be global state in the platform
implementation to keep track of this after it has been set.


&gt;<i> That's enough to be able to vary the duty cycle while keeping the
</I>&gt;<i> frequency the same.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

Yep.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, if they decide to vary the frequency without changing the
</I>&gt;<i> duty cycle, we would need to remember the duty cycle for each channel
</I>&gt;<i> in a tiny array duty[NUM_PWM] and presumably radix[NUM_PWM] to be able
</I>&gt;<i> to recalculate the duty cycle as a fraction of the PWM period when the
</I>&gt;<i> frequency alone is changed. That doesn't seem too hard or costly if it
</I>&gt;<i> gives a better Lua interface to the PWM module, and only needs to
</I>&gt;<i> happen in src/modules/pwm.c, not in every platform.
</I>

Yeah, and you would want to cache the passed numbers rather than fish them
out to fix the duty cycle on the fly so as to remain closer to what the user
asked for.  Unfortunately this also has an icky side effect of potentially
changing the exact duty cycle.


&gt;<i>  I hate to say it,
</I>&gt;<i> but that suggests keeping the C platform interface as it is, with freq
</I>&gt;<i> and duty always passed as a pair, otherwise we'll have the same code
</I>&gt;<i> to cache the duty cycle and radix in a dozen different places.  In the
</I>&gt;<i> case of AVR32, with its inability to set both at once, I already check
</I>&gt;<i> to see if the frequency (period) is the same as before and only update
</I>&gt;<i> the duty cycle in that case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I'd agree. There are a few ways to do it, but it is most convenient in the
platform code to have both at the same time, and it would help keep.  On the
one hand that means less modification to the platforms and less code, but as
you're pointing out it's problematic with AVR32.

Side note: is there some sort of pending or update flag that you could use
to set the two sequentially then grind away in a loop watching a register
for when that has been accepted, then you can change the other? Or can you
just watch the counter?  It certainly means burning extra time in the
function, especially if the frequency is quite slow, but perhaps worth it?



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Question: do PWM applications change the frequency without changing
</I>&gt;<i> the duty cycle? Well, I can think of an organ-like instrument where
</I>&gt;<i> the duty cycle gives a tone timbre and the frequency the note. For
</I>&gt;<i> that, the highest possible precision of the frequency setting is
</I>&gt;<i> critical: a hundredth of a percent of the frequency in use is the
</I>&gt;<i> target for musical pitches, so the more frequency precision the better
</I>&gt;<i> in that application.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That suggests in the Lua interface:
</I>&gt;<i> pwm.setduty( id, duty[, radix=100] )
</I>&gt;<i> pwm.setfreq( id, freq[, radix=1] )
</I>&gt;<i> and keeping the C platform interface the same as it is now, modulo
</I>&gt;<i> adding an extra duty/radix parameter.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Right.  There are a lot of applications where you won't touch frequency, but
will update duty cycle frequently, but audio applications would hold duty
cycle constant (for the most part), but vary the frequency all over.

With this, we would store duty and radix vales in the module, maybe with
some sane defaults set initially for whichever value isn't being set, like
50% for duty, and 1 KHz or something for frequency?


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It would be good to add in the documentation recommended usage
</I>&gt;<i> sequences.  For instance, what happens if I call pwm.start() before
</I>&gt;<i> setting the frequency and duty cycle for a channel?
</I>&gt;<i> Is a call to pwm.setup() necessary to enable the pin as an output,
</I>&gt;<i> even if we move the frequency and duty cycle stuff, that can happen
</I>&gt;<i> during the program run, elsewhere?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yeah, this is a good idea, and something we should do for other peripherals
like timers and the like as far as what state they're in without setting any
parameters.

I think having some sane, documented defaults for the unset parameter is not
a bad place to start (I guess we then might have to guarantee those won't
change in future versions?).  I suppose you could also do some things like
set the initial values to 0 or -1 and only call the platform function when
both have been filled in.   Let me know what you think about this...

On the pin configuration front, we could probably do it when the user calls
start, since this is the first point that the output actually needs to start
being reflected on the pin.  I suspect there shouldn't be any platform
situations where the pin needs to be configured in advance of other stuff.
 Also, ultimately, I think we need more of a common interface for supporting
various output pin configuration options, but that's a whole separate thread
that should be picked up sometime.




&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; James, have you been able to test on an ARm platform that patch to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; split platform_adc_op()
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I suppose I can take a look at the assembler generated for the at91
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; platform and try to see if it has optimized out that section you had
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; concerns about.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ah! I hadn't thought of that. Thanks. Yes, it is dutifully reading it
</I>&gt;<i> (and storing it in the dummy variable that is immediately forgotten,
</I>&gt;<i> der). Thanks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I add random numbers on the interval -0.5 -&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 0.5 to dither PWM duty cycles to get more precise output, and I'd like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to _not_ have to do that.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Urk! It's a sign that something is wrong with the interface if you
</I>&gt;<i> have to do such gymnastics.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yep.  It's ugly, but it did effectively increase resolution.  That was
around the point that I think I wrote the original suggestion for a variable
radix.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We could also do this in stages on a testing branch if we can't get
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all platforms tested and implemented quickly and only merge it once
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all platforms perform in a satisfactory manner.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When it means non-trivial reimplementation of platform code on a dozen
</I>&gt;<i> platforms, which may or may not work, that sounds wise.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When evolving the Lua interfaces, should we keep the current Lua
</I>&gt;<i> interfaces also, for example under
</I>&gt;<i> #ifdef ELUA_0_8_COMPAT
</I>&gt;<i> to allow existing Lua code to continue working, or do we just change
</I>&gt;<i> things to keep the code simpler and more manageable?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
We haven't used deprecation in the past. I'd vote for keeping things simple
for now.  I'd say that would be something that maybe might be necessary for
post-1.0 revisions to the API?

We should go through and update examples we've published to the newer API
and certainly make it clear in any release notes that updates are required
for code using the older style.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  I would suggest that we start
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; maybe with PWM _or_ ADC for this and not try to do both in the same
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; set of patches at the same time
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed. Let's hit PWM first
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Let me know what portions of this you would like to implement, if any.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Implementing the optional radix in the current pwm.setup() interface
</I>&gt;<i> seems like the smallest self-contained step we can take in this
</I>&gt;<i> direction, and the least disruptive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Sounds good.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Timers, for example,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; could do well to support the radix notation, and all of these should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have common code within given platforms so that once we've done one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the others should be easier on both platform implementation and common
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; code sides.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> They could. But if you mean for time delays, that has as a
</I>&gt;<i> prerequisite getting rid of the C platform_timer_op primitives, and
</I>&gt;<i> this is the second most difficult example of this to refactor, after
</I>&gt;<i> pio. Furthermore, they are already radix 1,000,000 (microseconds)
</I>&gt;<i> which may already be precise enough for delays. I'm not in favour of
</I>&gt;<i> implementing things just for a sense of symmetry, but only if the
</I>&gt;<i> upheaval brings a practical advantage.
</I>&gt;<i>  If you mean the frequency of free-running interrupts, tmr already
</I>&gt;<i> expresses that in microseconds, not Hz, so you already have high
</I>&gt;<i> precision at low frequencies.
</I>&gt;<i> But that also bring low precision at high frequencies :( so maybe this
</I>&gt;<i> is useful, to be able to express free-running interrupt periods (or
</I>&gt;<i> ADC conversion frequencies) at the precision of the underlying timer
</I>&gt;<i> clock (tmr.getclock()) to be able to get the best out of the hardware,
</I>&gt;<i> which may be clocking the timer at 200MHz.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yeah, I wouldn't just do it for symmetry, we can probably leave this alone
for now.  Given that we're using unsigned 32-bit integers the largest time
chunk we can express is ~71 minutes if I did that correctly... that's
probably fine for now.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure that having ADC sampling rates explicitly use a timers at
</I>&gt;<i> the interface level is ideal.
</I>&gt;<i> On the one hand, hardware that is able to sample at a given rate will
</I>&gt;<i> needlessly occupy a timer just because you have to say so in the Lua
</I>&gt;<i> interface.  On the other, if there is no other way to implement it on
</I>&gt;<i> a given platform it is better for it be explicit than hidden.
</I>&gt;<i> With the ADCs that I've seen on these platforms, you just kick them,
</I>&gt;<i> they convert as fast as they can and you the read the result back -
</I>&gt;<i> very different from the audio ADCs I'm used to.  That suggests,
</I>&gt;<i> instead of hijackng a timer, making the *user* do the stuff with
</I>&gt;<i> timers for periodic conversions, probably by an explicit periodic
</I>&gt;<i> timer interrupt that calls a kick-the-ADC routine, and limit the ADC
</I>&gt;<i> eLua interface to start-a-conversion, is-it-finished and
</I>&gt;<i> read-the-value, eliminating the buffering and the smoothing parts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I agree that there should be a mechanism to use interrupts to drive
conversions, but that gets back into the whole issue of jitter and latency.
 I think it would be a mistake to not allow use of the built-in timers to
trigger conversions since this is always going to be the most consistent,
low-jitter way to start a conversion.  It could be that setting up the timer
could be moved to a separate module, maybe a platform-specific extension.
 Certainly what you're suggesting would simplify the code and support of it,
but timing of conversions will be less ideal, and ditching the buffering +
smoothing and replicating that in pure Lua is going to be orders of
magnitude slower, especially if you're talking about maintaining that data
in Lua tables which pre-allocate more elements than you request and have a
high memory penalty.

Also, I'm not _that_ worried about tying up a timer for ADC conversions.
 Depending on the platform there are other things like PWM and encoder
interfaces that by definition of hardware implementation must suck up a
timer.  At least for ADC, it's still operating as a running timer, ideally
you can still request the frequency using the tmr module and use output from
it.. it will just be running at a frequency that's selected to enable ADC
conversions at the rate the user specified.  Providing the option to not use
one and drive it off of some other sort of interrupt is something that I do
plan to implement shortly.

Speaking of which: I did get a reply from Atmel regarding the timer
channels, and while I didn't get anything definitive, those that were asked
thought that it should work, so I might experiment with it.



&gt;<i> Already the DHCP server in UIP, and the serial console quietly hijack
</I>&gt;<i> a timer each to do timeouts, and between them they occupy both of the
</I>&gt;<i> usable timers on AVR32, leaving the user with only the virtual ones
</I>&gt;<i> with 1/10th second granularity. DHCP can easily be changed to use the
</I>&gt;<i> system tick while for the serial console it's only used to try and
</I>&gt;<i> detect LFCR sequences that can never occur.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yeah, this is stuff that clearly shouldn't be sucking up a timer, especially
in the ways that they're implemented (doesn't need interrupts, just polling
to get a measure of time).  We should be using system tick or an RTC where
available, and only if such a facility isn't available maybe document and
suck up a timer and use that in place of the RTC to provide a common system
clock that these things can run off of.

Regarding the serial console &amp; uart, it's used for timeouts, which for the
console might end up only coming down to that particular code (I can't
remember), but configurable timeouts are definitely useful for other
consumers of the UART services (LuaRPC, RFS &amp; MUX all use them).  That said
and all that behavior should come off of something like a system tick.
 Regarding the linefeed and carriage return sequence detection, it does
actually happen depending on the terminal being used.  This allows us to
automatically support various ways of ending a line without having some sort
of compile time option.  If I recall, before this was changed it was
something like default behavior from TeraTerm or some other terminal vs
using something like screen on Posix used different line endings (probably
CRLF on Windows, LF on posix OSes) and supporting one but not the other
would make it either irritating or impossible to use with one of the types
of line endings, depending on which you supported. So, what it's looking for
are CRLF sequences, but it also happens to handle LFCR if that happens to
occur (which apparently, according to Wikipedia, was used on Acorn BBC
spooled text output ;-) (<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline</A>)

I think a lot of problems would be solved by having a system tick timer
available as a resource for things like uarts, ethernet, mmcfs (which also
wants timeouts), and anything that needs consistent but relatively
coarse-grained timing intervals (running at a frequency between 10Hz and 1
Khz, maybe?).  Users could also get most of the timing functionality they
would normally derive from timers from this common facility as well.  Then
the remainder of timers are available for the user to select what they might
be consumed by: dedicated timing with the tmr module, periodic interrupts,
initiating scans/conversions on ADC, etc...

We could maybe look into this as one of the issues following on to the
others we've discussed since I've wanted this for some time as well :-)


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, it's a bit odd that free-running timer interrupts are the
</I>&gt;<i> only frequency in eLua that is expressed as a period. In fact, on the
</I>&gt;<i> subect of free-running timer interrupts, I think the
</I>&gt;<i> tmr.set_match_int( id, period, type )
</I>&gt;<i> (where type = tmr.INT_ONESHOT or tmr.INT_CYCLIC for a single
</I>&gt;<i> interrupts after a delay or to set free-running interrupts or
</I>&gt;<i> free-running ADC conversions) could be rethought.
</I>&gt;<i> The &quot;type&quot; parameter is surely always a constant in the user code, so
</I>&gt;<i> we could turn this into two functions. That would let us express an
</I>&gt;<i> interrupt after a delay as the usual time in microseconds, and the
</I>&gt;<i> frequency of free-running interrupts as a frequency with optional
</I>&gt;<i> radix, the same as all the other output-frequency operations.
</I>&gt;<i>  But let's see if that is a practical problem for anyone first.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It does feel a little odd given that we have all other cyclic stuff in Hz,
supporting the different notations with separate functions would be a fairly
clean way to make things more consistent, but it also would also complicate
the interfaces a bit to support both notations. Lets table that for now.

Best.
