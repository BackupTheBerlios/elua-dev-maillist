</I>
Ah, gotcha.  I could be a little bit pedantic here that in both 1 &amp; 2
there is clock division going on that is configurable, but I see what
you mean by the second class being ones that are based on something
like a timer counter with match values or overflow or something like
that that is being incremented by the first class.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I just used the words &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; because their typical ranges of
</I>&gt;<i> frequencies are higher and lower.
</I>&gt;<i> Shall we call then &quot;clocking frequencies&quot; and &quot;output frequencies&quot; or
</I>&gt;<i> something, to avoid the subjective associations of the words &quot;high&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> and &quot;low&quot;?
</I>
Sure.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By separating the different cases, we can reason more usefully about
</I>&gt;<i> each one, rather than talking about a single solution to three
</I>&gt;<i> different types of object.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It may be that what I have called &quot;low&quot; frequencies are not worth
</I>&gt;<i> making more precise, which would just leave PWM duty cycles.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>&#160;PWM can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> certainly run at a few megahertz on many of the platforms we use,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> though this doesn't provide excellent resolution in duty cycle.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As well as 1 or 2 hertz if used to flash christmas lights, where one
</I>&gt;<i> would be able to produce a slowly-accelerating flashing rate.
</I>&gt;<i> What I mean, again, is that these are lower frequencies derived from
</I>&gt;<i> the clocking rate. &#160;Of course, the divisor used to produce the output
</I>&gt;<i> frequency could even be 1, giving the same frequency as the clock
</I>&gt;<i> rate, but in terms of the program interface, that data object is still
</I>&gt;<i> an output frequency derived from the clocking frequency.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I actually have a minor dislike for the convention of the &quot;setup&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> function since they take different parameters depending on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> peripheral that's being setup.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have no problem aith that, since different devices need setting up
</I>&gt;<i> with different parameters.
</I>&gt;<i> For me, if the function sets the interface up (i.e. initializes it to
</I>&gt;<i> make it ready for subsequent use), then &quot;setup&quot; is OK.
</I>&gt;<i> I am concerned by a *.setup() function that doesn't set the interface
</I>&gt;<i> up, but is used to drive it!
</I>
I would agree here that this particular case has a stronger motivator behind it.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>&#160;As far as alternatives, maybe something like settimer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or setuptimer might make more sense? &#160;Alternately if we wanted ADC to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> support other trigger sources, it could be named something like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> settrigger or setuptrigger?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK, I'll leave you to think about that. I'm happy as long as
</I>&gt;<i> foo.setup() sets foo up ready to be used, foo.setclock() sets foo's
</I>&gt;<i> clock frequency and so on, so that when you read the Lua code, it
</I>&gt;<i> makes some kind of sense.
</I>
Gotcha.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Furthermore, on AVR32, being told to set both the frequency and duty
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; cycle causes a glitch in the output because the stupid hardware
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; interface can only set either the frequency or the duty cycle once per
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; output cycle so you get one cycle either at the new frequency and old
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; duty cycle or at the old frequency with the new duty cycle.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Interesting. &#160;I assume that you can temporarily stop the peripheral,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> set the values and then start it again though? &#160;Sure you might lose
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some clock cycles, but I'm not sure we're guaranteeing that PWM is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> continuous through successive calls. &#160;Not sure if we would need to do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so either.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The most demanding application I can think of is when it is being used
</I>&gt;<i> to signal data, such as in TV remote controls, where a blip at the
</I>&gt;<i> wrong frequency or duty cycle might make it do the wrong thing. Yes,
</I>&gt;<i> you can also stop the output, reprogram it and start again, though for
</I>&gt;<i> applications like using PWM to implement an audio DAC, that causes an
</I>&gt;<i> audible bubble in the output. I like producing good quality output
</I>&gt;<i> when that is possible, so that when people push the envelope, the
</I>&gt;<i> system doesn't let them down.
</I>
I agree there as well. Audio is probably a good example where this
sort of thing might become noticeable.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Worse yet, pwm.setup(id, frequency, duty_cycle) takes two parameters
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; both of which are in the proposed fixed-point format, which is ugly.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Even in the naive case where you get higher precision by giving a duty
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; cycle radix of 1000 or 1000000, you'd need to supply a bogus extra
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; parameter for the undesired precision of the PWM output frequency.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is another reason why I'm not a massive fan of &quot;setup&quot; functions,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I kindof think this should be two separate functions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Would we really need a radix other than 1 for PWM frequencies though?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm not sure if non-integer frequencies are ever needed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Flashing christmas lights?
</I>
That's a valid example. I might have considered using other methods to
support something in that frequency range, but that's a convenient way
to handle that type of system without having software in the loop at
each cycle.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; These are three arguments in favour of splitting pwm.setup() into two
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; functions like pwm.setfreq() and pwm.setduty(). &#160;A fourth is that all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; the other modules' setup() functions are usually called once at start
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; of program, then the output is varied as the program runs using
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; module-specific functions, whereas the current pwm.setup() is used
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; repeatedly while the programming is running to vary the output.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yeah, I've felt this way for a while now. &#160;Bogdan, any comments on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this front? We're starting to get into a number of API changes and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proposals here :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 3) The divisor returned is determined by the low-level code in order
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; to provide best accuracy in conveying the frequency selected given the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; available variable size for storing the values.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Trying to select the most precise pair of integers to represent an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; arbitrary value is actually quite a difficult math-theoretical
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; problem, not to mention the difficullty in the user code that would be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; necessary to correctly handle them.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is true. &#160;It's an optimization problem. &#160;There are some simple
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> single-shot approaches that have what are most likely acceptable error
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> levels like the one mentioned earlier. &#160;Really choosing things
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> optimally is harder and is iterative unless one has a lookup table.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'd be OK with selecting one that's not perfect, but could be adjusted
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a little to provide low error in the ranges that the peripherals are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> generally used.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't mean to say that they really need to be optimal, we would end
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> up wasting computational time and memory with some iterative
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> optimization algorithm or lookup tables. &#160;The reason that I said
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;maximum _potential_ return value accuracy&quot; was that this would give
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the backend implementer the most precise representation of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> frequency the user wanted. &#160;Again, I would be happy with a simple
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> non-iterative algorithm with a known worst-case that is acceptable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would drop this idea and keep it simple, returning values in the
</I>&gt;<i> same radix as the user passed, where that is appropriate.
</I>
Yep.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or, if we drop the proposal to make &quot;output&quot; frequencies more precise
</I>&gt;<i> (for the 27.27Hz ADCs in seismographs and for the xmas lights), that
</I>&gt;<i> only leaves PWM duty cycles, and in that case we don't return the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;actual&quot; duty cycle set at all, so the problem goes away.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>&#160;I would tend to agree that just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> going with fixed-point (powers of 10) might be the least messy to deal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have no problem if they want to express something in 360ths for some
</I>&gt;<i> reason of their own, or, in units of the period of the PWM cycle
</I>&gt;<i> counter to get max precision. Our code would be the same in any case,
</I>&gt;<i> without needing to impose artificial restrictions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can we focus on concrete proposals and decide?
</I>
Sure.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm in favour of adding optional extra parameter after duty cycles to
</I>&gt;<i> get higher precision (indeed, hardware precision if you pick the right
</I>&gt;<i> radix)
</I>
OK.  So something like:

duty, radix = pwm.setduty(id, duty, [radix=100])

Radix is free-form, but integer?


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm ambivalent about adding radix to frequencies for higher-precision
</I>&gt;<i> low frequencies. It would be nice.
</I>
Does one need the christmas lights to flash at 0.43 Hz?  I dunno.  PWM
can be used for triggering other things like, for example an external
ADC where that might be useful?

freq, radix = pwm.setfreq(id, freq, [radix=1])

For setting the clocking frequency, I don't think there's a good
reason (pwm.setclock).  Some platforms may not even support low
frequencies on this front and the few multipliers/dividers in line
would make it difficult to get precision on those that would make it
worth it.


Question: do we leave setup for now?  Do we provide radix functionality with it?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Lastly, these kinds of changes are hard because they have to be
</I>&gt;<i> implemented on every platform simultaneously, which either needs
</I>&gt;<i> someone who has all the platforms, or some tight collaboration.
</I>
Indeed.  I suppose we can stub out functionality for some platforms at
first and fill in support, but it would be nice to have them all as
much on the same page as possible.

&gt;<i> James, have you been able to test on an ARm platform that patch to
</I>&gt;<i> split platform_adc_op()
</I>
Yeah, sorry about not getting back to you on that. I ran out of time
last week and then ended up driving to a wedding (which I brought some
MCUs with me on, but had no time).

I have tested some but not all of the platforms yet.  It works fine
for me on LM3S &amp; STM32, but I'm having trouble finding the LPC 17xx
board I have, however looking at the code that one shouldn't be a
problem since there were already functions for providing the
functionality that pwm_op was using.  I guess I also have an LPC24xx
in the form of the PUC rio board, and an STR9 board that I can test.
I'll send results from those tonight since they're at home.  I can do
at least a build test for other platforms, but I don't have hardware.

I suppose I can take a look at the assembler generated for the at91
platform and try to see if it has optimized out that section you had
concerns about.  I can try and poke Bogdan to see if he can test this?


As far as getting changes like this implemented while I know I took a
bit on checking platform compatibility, but I'm in town for the coming
weeks and I'm willing to try and get this implemented/tested with
tighter, at least closer to daily, evaluation and feedback.  I'm also
happy to implement some of this myself since at least for the duty
cycles, I've wanted this for some time (I have a current project where
to effectively get this I add random numbers on the interval -0.5 -&gt;
0.5 to dither PWM duty cycles to get more precise output, and I'd like
to _not_ have to do that.)

We could also do this in stages on a testing branch if we can't get
all platforms tested and implemented quickly and only merge it once
all platforms perform in a satisfactory manner.

Let me know what portions of this you would like to implement, if any.


Thanks for both the work and the discussion. I'm glad to have some
section of this moving forward now.  I would suggest that we start
maybe with PWM _or_ ADC for this and not try to do both in the same
set of patches at the same time and move on to any other places we
want to implement this after we have done these.  Timers, for example,
could do well to support the radix notation, and all of these should
have common code within given platforms so that once we've done one
the others should be easier on both platform implementation and common
code sides.
