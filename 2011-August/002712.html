</I>
There is a bit that tells you when the pending update has been flushed.
For the moment, I'm just interested in getting the thing to work and
not worried about the processing the application could do while the
first update of the two is pending.

&gt;<i> but audio applications would hold duty

</I>
You mean organ-type audio.  Using PWM as a crude ADC would keep the
frequency at a fixed high and vary the duty cycle to varu the output
value.

&gt;<i> With this, we would store duty and radix vales in the module, maybe with
</I>&gt;<i> some sane defaults set initially for whichever value isn't being set, like
</I>&gt;<i> 50% for duty, and 1 KHz or something for frequency?
</I>
I'm not sure there are any sane defaults. I'd prefer that, until they
say what they want, we hold all output.  In my experience, arbitrary
defaults like 1kHz tend to become a ball and chain when it comes to
software maintenance in the future.

&gt;&gt;<i> When evolving the Lua interfaces, should we keep the current Lua
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interfaces also, for example under
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> #ifdef ELUA_0_8_COMPAT

</I>
OK. For me, maintaining backward compatibility is no problem - we just
have to make sure we never make the old parameters take on different
meanings, but that's a good defensive principle in any case. The only
difference is in code size for the backward-compatible version.

&gt;<i> I agree that there should be a mechanism to use interrupts to drive
</I>&gt;<i> conversions, but that gets back into the whole issue of jitter and latency.
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;I think it would be a mistake to not allow use of the built-in timers to
</I>&gt;<i> trigger conversions since this is always going to be the most consistent,
</I>&gt;<i> low-jitter way to start a conversion.
</I>
Right.  So what do we do for a Lua interface that can cope with
hardware that had a built-in precise conversion rate and hardware
where you have to fake it with timers, interrupts and kicking the ADC
periodically?

My feeling is to make a Lua interface that says &quot;sample at 100Hz&quot; and
then let the platform-dependent code decide whether the underlying
hardware has sample-at-100Hz hardware, or whether we need to fake that
using timers, interrupts and stuff.

I dunno. Being able to say &quot;give me 100 samples per second&quot; is nice,
but optionally hijacking one of the timers on most platforms is nasty.
Opinions?

&gt;<i> ditching the buffering +
</I>&gt;<i> smoothing and replicating that in pure Lua is going to be orders of
</I>&gt;<i> magnitude slower
</I>
My main problem with the current &quot;smoothing&quot; is that it is a hack. It
just averages a few of the previous samples.  On the one hand, this
offends me as a DSP nerd, since &quot;smoothing&quot; should be a low-pass
filter, with all the power math that finite-response filters involve,
while averaging the last few samples is more of a distortion effect
than a low-pass filter. It's something like a comb filter with a space
between the peaks equal to the length of your averaging buffer.
  My feeling is that, if you have a noisy input signal that jitters
due to noise above the sampling frequency, you should be low-pass
filtering it in hardware, with capacitors, resistors, inductore and
the like, to get a clean analog signal to sample with no frequency
components above 1/2 of the sampling frequency. Sampling a raw noisy
signal and averaging it to hide the worst of the artifacts seems like
a kludge by comparison.

&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline</A>)
</I>
Thanks. That concludes the discussion on this point. LFCR does not
exist, so we can dump this code and save a timer.

&gt;<i> I think a lot of problems would be solved by having a system tick timer
</I>&gt;<i> available as a resource for things like uarts, ethernet, mmcfs (which also
</I>&gt;<i> wants timeouts), and anything that needs consistent but relatively
</I>&gt;<i> coarse-grained timing intervals (running at a frequency between 10Hz and 1
</I>&gt;<i> Khz, maybe?)
</I>
We have that as long as virtual timers are enabled.
It would be better if system tick were not virtual timer-dependent,
but existed independently, of which Vtimers would be one of the
clients.
Anyone who wants to refactor that in the code is very welcome.

&gt;<i> &#160;Users could also get most of the timing functionality they
</I>&gt;<i> would normally derive from timers from this common facility as well. &#160;Then
</I>&gt;<i> the remainder of timers are available for the user to select what they might
</I>&gt;<i> be consumed by: dedicated timing with the tmr module, periodic interrupts,
</I>&gt;<i> initiating scans/conversions on ADC, etc...
</I>
Are you suggesting that we reserve one timer for internal purposes on
all platforms? I'm not sure that would even be enough, since we want
one for the system tick for coarse timing, another maybe to trigger
arbitrary-frequency ADC conversions... should we allocate timers
dynamically instead of presenting the user with a fixed number of
them?  Hum, this is getting scary...
