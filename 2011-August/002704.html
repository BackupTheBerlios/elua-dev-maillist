<PRE>I'll send this, cos it's been sitting in my outbox for 4 days and my
brain is elsewhere at present.

Integer, sure. A floating point radix is an interesting idea... :)

I'm not sure the radix needs to be returned from the functions, since
it will always be either 100 or what the user specified, so its value
is 100% predictable and so contains no information. It also simplifies
the documentation, so a beginner isn't immediately worried about
&quot;what's this extra radix thing that it might return&quot; and only power
users need to deal with funny radices.

OK. apart from returning radix again

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Question: do we leave setup for now? &#160;Do we provide radix functionality with it?
</I>
OK, let's think about this. If we split into setfreq() and setduty():
- what does it do when they have set a frequency but not set a duty cycle yet?
- What does it do if they set a duty cycle but haven't set a frequency yet?
The platform code I have seen for the current pwm.setup() always goes:
{
   set pwm period in the hardware, calculated from the requested
frequency and clock rate;
   set duty cycle as a period in clock ticks calculated from the pwm period;
}
Maybe for this reason it is handy always to have the frequency and
duty cycle on hand at the same time. However, from the platform code
I've seen, when setting the duty cycle separately, you can fish the
period (that you need for the calculation) back out of the hardware
register.
That's enough to be able to vary the duty cycle while keeping the
frequency the same.

However, if they decide to vary the frequency without changing the
duty cycle, we would need to remember the duty cycle for each channel
in a tiny array duty[NUM_PWM] and presumably radix[NUM_PWM] to be able
to recalculate the duty cycle as a fraction of the PWM period when the
frequency alone is changed. That doesn't seem too hard or costly if it
gives a better Lua interface to the PWM module, and only needs to
happen in src/modules/pwm.c, not in every platform.  I hate to say it,
but that suggests keeping the C platform interface as it is, with freq
and duty always passed as a pair, otherwise we'll have the same code
to cache the duty cycle and radix in a dozen different places.  In the
case of AVR32, with its inability to set both at once, I already check
to see if the frequency (period) is the same as before and only update
the duty cycle in that case.

Question: do PWM applications change the frequency without changing
the duty cycle? Well, I can think of an organ-like instrument where
the duty cycle gives a tone timbre and the frequency the note. For
that, the highest possible precision of the frequency setting is
critical: a hundredth of a percent of the frequency in use is the
target for musical pitches, so the more frequency precision the better
in that application.

That suggests in the Lua interface:
pwm.setduty( id, duty[, radix=100] )
pwm.setfreq( id, freq[, radix=1] )
and keeping the C platform interface the same as it is now, modulo
adding an extra duty/radix parameter.

It would be good to add in the documentation recommended usage
sequences.  For instance, what happens if I call pwm.start() before
setting the frequency and duty cycle for a channel?
Is a call to pwm.setup() necessary to enable the pin as an output,
even if we move the frequency and duty cycle stuff, that can happen
during the program run, elsewhere?

&gt;&gt;<i> James, have you been able to test on an ARm platform that patch to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> split platform_adc_op()
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I suppose I can take a look at the assembler generated for the at91
</I>&gt;<i> platform and try to see if it has optimized out that section you had
</I>&gt;<i> concerns about.
</I>
Ah! I hadn't thought of that. Thanks. Yes, it is dutifully reading it
(and storing it in the dummy variable that is immediately forgotten,
der). Thanks.

&gt;<i> I add random numbers on the interval -0.5 -&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 0.5 to dither PWM duty cycles to get more precise output, and I'd like
</I>&gt;<i> to _not_ have to do that.)
</I>
Urk! It's a sign that something is wrong with the interface if you
have to do such gymnastics.

&gt;<i> We could also do this in stages on a testing branch if we can't get
</I>&gt;<i> all platforms tested and implemented quickly and only merge it once
</I>&gt;<i> all platforms perform in a satisfactory manner.
</I>
When it means non-trivial reimplementation of platform code on a dozen
platforms, which may or may not work, that sounds wise.

When evolving the Lua interfaces, should we keep the current Lua
interfaces also, for example under
#ifdef ELUA_0_8_COMPAT
to allow existing Lua code to continue working, or do we just change
things to keep the code simpler and more manageable?

&gt;<i> &#160;I would suggest that we start
</I>&gt;<i> maybe with PWM _or_ ADC for this and not try to do both in the same
</I>&gt;<i> set of patches at the same time
</I>
Agreed. Let's hit PWM first

&gt;<i> Let me know what portions of this you would like to implement, if any.
</I>
Implementing the optional radix in the current pwm.setup() interface
seems like the smallest self-contained step we can take in this
direction, and the least disruptive.

&gt;<i>&#160;Timers, for example,
</I>&gt;<i> could do well to support the radix notation, and all of these should
</I>&gt;<i> have common code within given platforms so that once we've done one
</I>&gt;<i> the others should be easier on both platform implementation and common
</I>&gt;<i> code sides.
</I>
They could. But if you mean for time delays, that has as a
prerequisite getting rid of the C platform_timer_op primitives, and
this is the second most difficult example of this to refactor, after
pio. Furthermore, they are already radix 1,000,000 (microseconds)
which may already be precise enough for delays. I'm not in favour of
implementing things just for a sense of symmetry, but only if the
upheaval brings a practical advantage.
 If you mean the frequency of free-running interrupts, tmr already
expresses that in microseconds, not Hz, so you already have high
precision at low frequencies.
But that also bring low precision at high frequencies :( so maybe this
is useful, to be able to express free-running interrupt periods (or
ADC conversion frequencies) at the precision of the underlying timer
clock (tmr.getclock()) to be able to get the best out of the hardware,
which may be clocking the timer at 200MHz.

I'm not sure that having ADC sampling rates explicitly use a timers at
the interface level is ideal.
On the one hand, hardware that is able to sample at a given rate will
needlessly occupy a timer just because you have to say so in the Lua
interface.  On the other, if there is no other way to implement it on
a given platform it is better for it be explicit than hidden.
With the ADCs that I've seen on these platforms, you just kick them,
they convert as fast as they can and you the read the result back -
very different from the audio ADCs I'm used to.  That suggests,
instead of hijackng a timer, making the *user* do the stuff with
timers for periodic conversions, probably by an explicit periodic
timer interrupt that calls a kick-the-ADC routine, and limit the ADC
eLua interface to start-a-conversion, is-it-finished and
read-the-value, eliminating the buffering and the smoothing parts.

Already the DHCP server in UIP, and the serial console quietly hijack
a timer each to do timeouts, and between them they occupy both of the
usable timers on AVR32, leaving the user with only the virtual ones
with 1/10th second granularity. DHCP can easily be changed to use the
system tick while for the serial console it's only used to try and
detect LFCR sequences that can never occur.

Actually, it's a bit odd that free-running timer interrupts are the
only frequency in eLua that is expressed as a period. In fact, on the
subect of free-running timer interrupts, I think the
tmr.set_match_int( id, period, type )
(where type = tmr.INT_ONESHOT or tmr.INT_CYCLIC for a single
interrupts after a delay or to set free-running interrupts or
free-running ADC conversions) could be rethought.
The &quot;type&quot; parameter is surely always a constant in the user code, so
we could turn this into two functions. That would let us express an
interrupt after a delay as the usual time in microseconds, and the
frequency of free-running interrupts as a frequency with optional
radix, the same as all the other output-frequency operations.
  But let's see if that is a practical problem for anyone first.
