<PRE>&gt;<i> I agree.  Does the performance hit only show up during a GC (emergency or
</I>&gt;<i> no)?  I've not clocked any of this yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, the performance hit happens only during GC, which becomes a visible
problem when GC is called too often. But hey, at least your program is
running :)


&gt;<i> In practice I would say since we have a fixed amount of memory, it's really
</I>&gt;<i> undesirable to fail simply because a garbage collection event wasn't called
</I>&gt;<i> in time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Definitely.


&gt;<i> The other side is that if the penalty is only at GC time, people could
</I>&gt;<i> disable collection during time-critical operations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Definitely, part II :)


&gt;<i> I haven't taken a deep look to understand how every part of the patch works
</I>&gt;<i> yet, but I see that it does provide a configurable of a memory limit.  Maybe
</I>&gt;<i> another interesting tunable might be how many GC steps to take when an
</I>&gt;<i> emergency GC is called (i.e.: just enough for the allocation pending, full
</I>&gt;<i> gc, or something else?)  I'm also still curious about the idea of running GC
</I>&gt;<i> in fixed timesteps,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I did quite a few tests with Robert's patch a while ago, I really need to
look for my messages related to this subject on the Lua list and repost them
here. They're quite interesting.



&gt;<i> In the interests of pragmatism, I don't think I'd pursue anything more
</I>&gt;<i> detailed here unless I run up against some situation where it doesn't work
</I>&gt;<i> as desired. I think, overall, a default of sane incremental collection
</I>&gt;<i> (maybe with the GCPAUSE set to 110) and a backstop emergency GC should be a
</I>&gt;<i> good solution for most cases.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I'd say a configurable emergency GC should be a good solution for most
cases. That is, the user should be able to define how the emergency GC will
run, which will give him a choice between speed and memory usage. Not hard
to do, fortunately. Again, things will probably be more clear after I post
the results of Robert's patch here.

Best,
Bogdan
