</I>
I had the same questions the first time I read this article and dug  
around.  The sources are indeed in that inferno-os project on google  
code:
<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/inferno-os/source/browse/#svn/trunk/appl/demo/">http://code.google.com/p/inferno-os/source/browse/#svn/trunk/appl/demo/</A> 
lego
<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/inferno-os/source/browse/#svn/trunk/lib/lego">http://code.google.com/p/inferno-os/source/browse/#svn/trunk/lib/lego</A>
etc..  haven't dug around to try and figure out exactly what all is  
needed from those sources to have a working chunk.

This might be useful too:
<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/inferno-ds/">http://code.google.com/p/inferno-ds/</A>

Now, on to interfacing from Linux, Windows, etc..:
Linux has had v9fs included for some time: <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V9fs">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V9fs</A>
There are also numerous implementations of the server/client in  
various languages:
<A HREF="http://9p.cat-v.org/implementations">http://9p.cat-v.org/implementations</A>
I can't imagine it would be too hard to take a C implementation and  
hook it in with Lua.

I wouldn't necessarily expect that it show up as a real filesystem on  
all the platforms that would interface with it, I think in most cases  
they would just be used through a library that speaks the protocol.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not necessarily automount, I was more just thinking of a common  
</I>&gt;<i> interface so that if one say added a new wireless stack and  
</I>&gt;<i> conformed with the interface one could just use this transport layer  
</I>&gt;<i> for console, rpc, etc without needing to do something custom for  
</I>&gt;<i> each usage modality. I realize to some extent that this modality  
</I>&gt;<i> might beak down somewhere but as with 9p one it seems like there  
</I>&gt;<i> should be a possibility for a common filelike interface for not just  
</I>&gt;<i> files but communication, direct control of non-file resources etc...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Interesting, and it makes sense. And, as I said, this idea haunted  
</I>&gt;<i> me too :) Maybe 9p is simple/robust enough to make this possible in  
</I>&gt;<i> eLua. Not sure yet.
</I>
I'm not sure either.  I also don't know what the overhead looks like  
for the implementations that are out there.  Conceptually it's quite  
powerful, but I'm not convinced whether it is a good or bad fit.  The  
Styx-on-a-brick project was particularly of interest because it  
suggests that it can be used on the class of devices eLua considers  
home :-)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This would be nice to have. Have you read Ralph Hempel's article in  
</I>&gt;<i> lua gems?  I juat got the book this week.  He doesn't provide all  
</I>&gt;<i> the details but he does discuss some of the decisions he made about  
</I>&gt;<i> the c library as well as some of the math library
</I>&gt;<i> choices. In particular his &quot;flong&quot; implementation, and I think he  
</I>&gt;<i> got his single precision math library from sdcc (small device c  
</I>&gt;<i> compiler). I somewhat wish there were more detail (or sources :) but  
</I>&gt;<i> he does provide some interesting pointers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I talked to Ralph, and it turns out that he chose the Minix libc too  
</I>&gt;<i> for pbLua :)  So we're on the right track here. About the floating  
</I>&gt;<i> point emulation library, I'm still looking for alternatives. The  
</I>&gt;<i> sdcc idea is nice, thanks for that. But this is one area in which  
</I>&gt;<i> eLua and pbLua are different. If I'm not mistaken, pbLua can't even  
</I>&gt;<i> be compiled with the number type set to double, it's integer by  
</I>&gt;<i> default and uses a separate library for floating point numbers  
</I>&gt;<i> (which is a nice idea and we'll have it too one day). So our choice  
</I>&gt;<i> of a floating point emulation library might have to be different. I  
</I>&gt;<i> worked on three floating point emulation libraries myself a while  
</I>&gt;<i> ago, and I know how very tricky they can get, so we need to be  
</I>&gt;<i> careful.
</I>
Yeah, I don't think it supports double.  He uses the &quot;flong&quot; (<A HREF="http://lua-users.org/lists/lua-l/2007-05/msg00306.html">http://lua-users.org/lists/lua-l/2007-05/msg00306.html</A> 
) to handle things as longs if there's no decimal point and floats if  
they have one.  It's an interesting tradeoff, but I don't think we'd  
want to give up support for higher precision (when wanted/needed).  I  
would tend towards whatever solution requires minimal maintenance and  
code.  I suspect any transition could be done gradually rather than  
having to wholesale make a switch?

Does the branch you've put together work as-is or is it more of a work- 
in-progress?
