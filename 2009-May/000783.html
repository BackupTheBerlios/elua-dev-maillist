<PRE>&gt;<i> Hi -
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I just wanted to let folks know that I'm working on getting LuaRPC (
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://q12.org/lua/index.html">http://q12.org/lua/index.html</A>) up and running for eLua.  I've gotten it
</I>&gt;<i> going with Lua 5.1.4 on the desktop, and it seems to be working to the
</I>&gt;<i> degree that can initiate procedure calls with tables, numbers, etc.. as
</I>&gt;<i> arguments, and get return values back over local socket connections.
</I>

Excellent news!


&gt;<i> The original code doesn't support shipping functions over the wire, but I
</I>&gt;<i> think it should be possible to do this with lua_dump, so that one could
</I>&gt;<i> modify functions on the remote &quot;server&quot; device (which in this case would be
</I>&gt;<i> eLua).  I'll drop it into eLua when I get it working over serial, which I
</I>&gt;<i> think, at least in principle, should be fairly easy.
</I>

Functions aren't hard, using lua_dump should do the trick just fine. The
tricky part becomes apparent if the function uses any kind of globals. I
think you can actually have a dumper that can send the full function
environment, including its globals, by using the debug library to analyze
it, but I wouldn't go there personally. Executing something like
&quot;pio.set(1)&quot; remotely doesn't need any of that stuff, and it's what most
people need anyway.
About serial/socket: you probably thought about this already, but just in
case: remember to make your code as transport independent as possible. It
would be nice to use the PC to call function from a robot running eLua via a
radio connection at some point in the future :)
I'm also thinking about duplicating this for C functions; that is, having a
very simple, restricted, yet functional RPC mechanism that would work
directly for C functions. I did something like this with an AVR a while ago,
and it worked quite nicely.


&gt;<i> The Lua API has gone through some interesting changes between 4.0.x and
</I>&gt;<i> 5.1.x. I think I've mostly covered the bases as far as handling those
</I>&gt;<i> differences, but the only testing I've done is with some examples provided
</I>&gt;<i> by the original author.
</I>

Hmmm. Anyone knows of a good test package for RPC systems? I don't.

Best,
Bogdan
