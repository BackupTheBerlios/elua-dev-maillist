<PRE>Hi,

First idea was to write a small script language on my own, but after some
&gt;<i> research,
</I>&gt;<i> I decided to try Lua - even if it is much more powerful than my needs. I
</I>&gt;<i> tried to
</I>&gt;<i> get Lua 5.1.4 running, but it was not that easy as I thought. Main problem
</I>&gt;<i> was the
</I>&gt;<i> need for a filesystem, which is not avaialble.
</I>

It should be possible to make Lua run without a file system, although I
didn't try this myself (you can try searching for this on the Lua list).
It's true though that you should modify the code, or at least provide a
&quot;dummy&quot; buffered I/O library tailored to your needs.

eLua seems to solve my problem, and even more I got a filesystem, terminal
&gt;<i> mode,
</I>&gt;<i> and more. I haven't checked eLua until now, because I'm not sure if this is
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> right direction. I get more than I need, which have to be paid with ROM.
</I>

eLua is highly configurable, in most cases you can specify what you want to
be built into your image and what you don't. eLua without terminal mode, for
example, is as easy as not defining BUILD_TERM in your platform's
platform_conf.h file. Other components are equally easy to remove.


&gt;<i> Do you think Lua | eLua is the right thing to put a small script language
</I>&gt;<i> to a limited
</I>&gt;<i> device?
</I>

eLua is quite OK for this configuration, as it was built with this kind of
requirements in mind. You might also try some variant of Forth (which is a
completely different language though) or PyMite (
<A HREF="http://pymite.python-hosting.com/">http://pymite.python-hosting.com/</A>).
Lua is also probably good enough for you, as long as you can figure your
filesystem dependency problem. Compared to Lua though, eLua is optimized for
usage on small devices, including (important) memory allocation tunings and
a patch called LTR (Lua Tiny RAM) that can have an important impact on your
RAM usage.


&gt;<i> Do I have to use eLua (which is under GPL/BSD license)? Or should it be
</I>&gt;<i> even
</I>&gt;<i> possible to use &quot;plain&quot; Lua (which offers more flexible MIT license)?
</I>

eLua is MIT at this point, although this isn't specified in the license
file. We are planning to make the official announcement to MIT starting with
the next release, but you can use the code as you want even now. If you need
it, I'll change the LICENSE file right away.


&gt;<i> As I wrote, I neither need a FS, GUI nor a terminal mode. Lua scripts are
</I>&gt;<i> written to
</I>&gt;<i> the device with a proprietary mechanism. Maximum length of Lua script is
</I>&gt;<i> ~250 lines.
</I>&gt;<i> At the end each LOC is stored in one separate string.
</I>

The upcoming documentation for 0.6, although not 100% complete, contains a
lot of information about eLua in general and about how to configure its
components at compile time it in particular. It also contains information
about the LTR patch and other important parts of eLua. I'll upload it to a
temporary location today when I have some time and then come back to the
list with the link, maybe this will be help.

Best,
Bogdan
