I finally got a working i686-elf toolchain compiled and eLua to boot in a VirualBox instance.

Also I found out that eLua will not start when using the Lilo boot loader.  I was trying Lilo first since it is smaller then grub and I thought it would be easier to install eLua on a floppy.  Turned out that it was much easier to install grub on a floppy and there was enough room for eLua too.

With the patch you can now set a memory limit when starting a Lua script from the eLua shell.

eLua# lua -m 51 /rom/life.lua

The '-m' option lets you set the memory limit in Kbytes.

51Kbytes was the lowwest I was able to get life.lua to run at with eLua.  On my linux host vanilla Lua with the EGC patch can only run life.lua with a minimal memory limit of 60Kbytes.  Looks like the ROTables in eLua saved about 9Kbytes here.

The attached patch is for stress testing the EGC only.  It forces a full GC cycle on every allocation, so it is very slow (life.lua required over 30 minutes to run, compared to 4 minutes).  I was able to run all the Lua scripts that eLua includes by default with that stress testing enabled.

Normally I would also run the stress testing under valgrind to test for any bad memory accesses, but that is only possible if eLua is run as an app. under a host OS.

&gt;<i> &gt; And I couldn't agree with you more, and this why I feel so excited
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for having EGC in eLua. I'll have to think of a good batch of tests
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for making your patch shine in its full potential :)

It should be possible to pick torture tests that will work with just 64k of memory.

I normally run the Lua scripts from:
<A HREF="http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/">http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/</A>

when stress testing the EGC patch.  Some of those scripts will require more then 64k for that dataset that they process.
