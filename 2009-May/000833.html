<PRE>Update and notes on LuaRPC:

I've now both gotten it working on 5.1.4 and have abstracted out the  
transport layer.  As it stands which &quot;transport&quot; one uses is a compile- 
time option set by enabling or disabling some defines in config.h, but  
both serial (using pty to simulate real serial) and socket connections  
seem to be working at the moment for desktop use.  It's still somewhat  
rough around the edges, and I'd like to be able to support multiple  
transports from a single compilation, but I've not decided how I might  
want to do that yet (multiple modules?  function pointers that allow  
switching within a single module file?).

The existing module uses C-based exceptions to deal with transport- 
layer errors (take a look at luarpc_rpc.h if you're interested).  I  
know we're not really using exceptions for most of the eLua modules,  
but I'm wondering whether I should leave that in place, or change that  
in order to be friendly to porting.  As it is set up, it doesn't have  
to derive from errno codes defined by system libraries (not sure  
whether Newlib provides an errno global), so if custom codes or  
strings are needed they can be set up.  I think, though, with the  
current flow, some exceptions will need to be thrown in order to  
enable connection resets when the client disappears, or if bad data is  
sent/received.

Additionally, argument handling for connection setup that varies  
between transports is included in the &quot;transport&quot; side of the code, so  
the API to the transport layer includes a few functions that want a  
lua_State.  This feels a bit undesirable to me since some of them push  
stuff onto the stack depending on what args are given to them, and  
that number has to be passed back up the chain of called functions,  
since none of the transport layer functions are called directly from  
Lua.

Also, beyond whatever was included in the original code, I've not done  
anything special security-wise to prevent clients from doing nasty  
things.  That said, if you were letting someone connect to a LuaRPC  
server, you were already letting them run arbitrary code on your  
server (unless you disable loadstring), so... :-)

I think I'll have an eLua serial backend going sometime in the near  
future, and I'll certainly mention that when it's ready to be abused.

Current work is still in the same place:
