<PRE>&gt;<i> Linux has had v9fs included for some time:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V9fs">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V9fs</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Somehow, I'm not surprised :) Even if it wasn't, there's always FUSE in
Linux.


&gt;<i>  &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V9fs">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V9fs</A>&gt;There are also numerous
</I>&gt;<i> implementations of the server/client in various languages:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://9p.cat-v.org/implementations">http://9p.cat-v.org/implementations</A>
</I>&gt;<i> I can't imagine it would be too hard to take a C implementation and hook it
</I>&gt;<i> in with Lua.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Apparently there's at least a FUSE-like software for Windows and MAC too :
<A HREF="http://yukoba.accelart.jp/2008/05/windows-fuse-dokan-become-open-source.html.">http://yukoba.accelart.jp/2008/05/windows-fuse-dokan-become-open-source.html.</A>
Then again, if we have FUSE, we can implement pretty much everything we like
:<i>), as simple or complex as we want it.
</I>

&gt;<i> I wouldn't necessarily expect that it show up as a real filesystem on all
</I>&gt;<i> the platforms that would interface with it, I think in most cases they would
</I>&gt;<i> just be used through a library that speaks the protocol.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Nice too, but having it as another file system would be simply beautiful.


&gt;<i> I'm not sure either.  I also don't know what the overhead looks like for
</I>&gt;<i> the implementations that are out there.  Conceptually it's quite powerful,
</I>&gt;<i> but I'm not convinced whether it is a good or bad fit.  The Styx-on-a-brick
</I>&gt;<i> project was particularly of interest because it suggests that it can be used
</I>&gt;<i> on the class of devices eLua considers home :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That's what caught my attention too. Their MCU is far less limited than any
of eLua's current targets, so it should be more than OK for us.

Yeah, I don't think it supports double.  He uses the &quot;flong&quot; (
&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://lua-users.org/lists/lua-l/2007-05/msg00306.html">http://lua-users.org/lists/lua-l/2007-05/msg00306.html</A>)&lt;<A HREF="http://lua-users.org/lists/lua-l/2007-05/msg00306.html%29">http://lua-users.org/lists/lua-l/2007-05/msg00306.html%29</A>&gt;to handle things as longs if there's no decimal point and floats if they
</I>&gt;<i> have one.  It's an interesting tradeoff, but I don't think we'd want to give
</I>&gt;<i> up support for higher precision (when wanted/needed).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Nope, we don't want that.


&gt;<i> I would tend towards whatever solution requires minimal maintenance and
</I>&gt;<i> code.  I suspect any transition could be done gradually rather than having
</I>&gt;<i> to wholesale make a switch?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Sure. Whatever is missing will be linked in from Newlib, and eventually
Newlib will vanish completely. Hopefully before the mayan calendar ends ...
:<i>) Mind you, it's not only a question of libraries, we also have to
</I>(almost?) completely replace the header files without upsetting the
toolchain. And do this in a platform-independent manner. All in all, not an
easy task.


&gt;<i> Does the branch you've put together work as-is or is it more of a
</I>&gt;<i> work-in-progress?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It is 100% WIP. Although I'm pretty sure that the basic stuff (like
string-related functions for example) are already working. But I didn't test
them yet.

Best,
Bogdan
