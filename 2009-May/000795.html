</I>&gt;<i> to them via read/write/ioctl like a regular file has a lot of  
</I>&gt;<i> advantages, as well as some disadvantages. It sure seems tempting :)
</I>
OK. That's basically what I was wanting to know. On this front it  
would be nice. I also thought about trying to support rpc or exposing  
resources through plan 9's 9p. The Styx on a brick project (<A HREF="http://www.vitanuova.com/inferno/rcx_paper.html">http://www.vitanuova.com/inferno/rcx_paper.html</A> 
) from a few years back implemented this resource sharing/filesystem  
protocol on a lego mindstorms brick.  There's source for it on a  
google code project (<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/inferno-os/">http://code.google.com/p/inferno-os/</A>) but I'm not  
sure if I'll get around to trying this or something similar. Part of  
the idea in plan 9 was to expose pretty much every resource through  
the filesystem, 9p is the protocol used.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or should I have it work on a different level?  I think that the  
</I>&gt;<i> device manager functions should over the bases for what the RPC  
</I>&gt;<i> library needs (pretty much just sending and receiving bytes).  It  
</I>&gt;<i> might be nice for it to &quot;automatically&quot; work if a new new transport  
</I>&gt;<i> comes in so long as it conforms to an interface standard.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Something like an automount daemon, if I got it right. eLua is  
</I>&gt;<i> getting some file systems, so it should also get a &quot;mount&quot; command,  
</I>&gt;<i> and maybe even an automount, but again, I'm not sure that the  
</I>&gt;<i> current implementation allows for something more than just  
</I>&gt;<i> operations on regular file. It might though. It definitely works on  
</I>&gt;<i> consoles :), but a RPC transpor is probably too much for it. Even  
</I>&gt;<i> with desktop systems we have to use very different functions when  
</I>&gt;<i> writing to a console and writing to sockets, for example. That's why  
</I>&gt;<i> I said that I'd rather have some specialized functions in the  
</I>&gt;<i> platform interface for this, rather than making the device manager  
</I>&gt;<i> (which is a pretentious name for a very simple piece of code) much  
</I>&gt;<i> smarter than it is.
</I>
Not necessarily automount, I was more just thinking of a common  
interface so that if one say added a new wireless stack and conformed  
with the interface one could just use this transport layer for  
console, rpc, etc without needing to do something custom for each  
usage modality. I realize to some extent that this modality might beak  
down somewhere but as with 9p one it seems like there should be a  
possibility for a common filelike interface for not just files but  
communication, direct control of non-file resources etc...

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2.
</I>&gt;<i> Are the devman and stubs the main things that are newlib specific?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes. And because of this it will change a lot when we give eLua its  
</I>&gt;<i> own libc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If one were thinking about working on top of another libc, where  
</I>&gt;<i> should one be focusing to need to find equivalent facilities in  
</I>&gt;<i> another C library?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is already a branch in SVN on which I started to work on eLua  
</I>&gt;<i> with its own libc, which is a modified (well, almost _unmodified_ at  
</I>&gt;<i> this point) version of the Minix project's libc. Small, optimized  
</I>&gt;<i> for size, quite easy to understand and released under BSD, that's  
</I>&gt;<i> all we need :) There is _a lot_ of work to be done there, some  
</I>&gt;<i> trivial, some not quite so (like deciding if we also use the math  
</I>&gt;<i> emulation library from Minix (which I don't fully understand yet) ),  
</I>&gt;<i> but I think we can go there. And once we do, the advantages are huge  
</I>&gt;<i> IMO: complete portability, complete control over the library and how  
</I>&gt;<i> it works (so we can implement our stubs however we wish), reduced  
</I>&gt;<i> code size, (obviously) no more Newlib ... a dream come true :)
</I>
This would be nice to have. Have you read Ralph Hempel's article in  
lua gems?  I juat got the book this week.  He doesn't provide all the  
details but he does discuss some of the decisions he made about the c  
library as well as some of the math library choices. In particular his  
&quot;flong&quot; implementation, and I think he got his single precision math  
library from sdcc (small device c compiler). I somewhat wish there  
were more detail (or sources :) but he does provide some interesting  
pointers.
