<PRE>Hello eLua list,

I am the creator of the Emergency Garbage Collection (EGC) patch for Lua 
5.1.x.  I joined this list because I have interest in using Lua VM with a 
very low memory limit and I think that over laps with embedded systems.

Attached is a version of the EGC patch for eLua SVN revision 281.  I just had 
to updated line numbers so it would apply cleanly to eLua without any 
warnings.

I have only done minimal testing.  Had problems with getting newlib compiled 
on my 32bit Gentoo linux box so that I could test eLua standalone inside 
Vmware.  So I ended up only testing eLua's modified copy of Lua as a linux 
app. and only tested life.lua and bisect.lua (I just pick two from the romfs 
folder).  life.lua was able to run with the memory limit set to 60Kbytes.  
The attched 'linux_host.patch' file are the changes I made to eLua so I could 
test it.

For testing &amp; debugging what tools do other people use?  Remote gdb over 
serial?  I might be able to do more testing tomorrow, right now I am to 
tired.

About 2/3 of the EGC patch is to make the resizing of the internal string 
table &amp; hashpart of Lua table use less memory.  That is done by doing an 
in-place resize of those tables.  If the table is shrinking then the nodes 
are moved to the start of the table then realloc is called to shrink the 
table.  If the table is growing then the realloc is done first before the 
nodes are moved.  All of these changes are in lstring.c &amp; ltable.c and I 
don't see any conflict with the change eLua made to vanilla Lua.

The only place where the GC needed to grow memory usage before shrinking usage 
is when it is trying to shrink the internal string table or the hashpart of 
Lua tables.

&gt;<i> Another thought:  One of the reasons we don't have determinism in
</I>&gt;<i> execution times is because of GC.  I've not dug into how the Lua GC

</I>&gt;<i> could run it for a fixed length of time at that frequency to control
</I>&gt;<i> latency?
</I>
I think you could improve the determinism of the GC by changing the 
luaC_step() function to limit each incremental GC step to some fixed length 
of time (or cpu cycles if that is cheap to test).  This should be a simple 
change to the luaC_step() function, since it already calls the singlestep() 
function multiple times until X number of bytes have been freed or the end of 
the current GC cycle has been reached.

I still think that low memory systems should use the EGC to fully utilize the 
limited memory they have.
