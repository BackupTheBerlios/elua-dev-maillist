<PRE>&gt;<i> OK. That's basically what I was wanting to know. On this front it would be
</I>&gt;<i> nice. I also thought about trying to support rpc or exposing resources
</I>&gt;<i> through plan 9's 9p. The Styx on a brick project (
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.vitanuova.com/inferno/rcx_paper.html">http://www.vitanuova.com/inferno/rcx_paper.html</A>) from a few years back
</I>&gt;<i> implemented this resource sharing/filesystem protocol on a lego mindstorms
</I>&gt;<i> brick.  There's source for it on a google code project (
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/inferno-os/">http://code.google.com/p/inferno-os/</A>) but I'm not sure if I'll get around
</I>&gt;<i> to trying this or something similar. Part of the idea in plan 9 was to
</I>&gt;<i> expose pretty much every resource through the filesystem, 9p is the protocol
</I>&gt;<i> used.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Very interesting, I wasn't aware of the existence of plan 9. I took a quick
look at the protocol, and it sounds fine. Couldn't find the source code for
Styx-on-a-Brick (<A HREF="http://www.vitanuova.com/inferno/rcx_paper.html">http://www.vitanuova.com/inferno/rcx_paper.html</A>) after a
quick googling, but I'll keep on trying :) Still not sure how to interface
with this from Linux (although I'm sure there's a way), not to mention
Windows.


&gt;<i> Not necessarily automount, I was more just thinking of a common interface
</I>&gt;<i> so that if one say added a new wireless stack and conformed with the
</I>&gt;<i> interface one could just use this transport layer for console, rpc, etc
</I>&gt;<i> without needing to do something custom for each usage modality. I realize to
</I>&gt;<i> some extent that this modality might beak down somewhere but as with 9p one
</I>&gt;<i> it seems like there should be a possibility for a common filelike interface
</I>&gt;<i> for not just files but communication, direct control of non-file resources
</I>&gt;<i> etc...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Interesting, and it makes sense. And, as I said, this idea haunted me too :)
Maybe 9p is simple/robust enough to make this possible in eLua. Not sure
yet.

This would be nice to have. Have you read Ralph Hempel's article in lua
&gt;<i> gems?  I juat got the book this week.  He doesn't provide all the details
</I>&gt;<i> but he does discuss some of the decisions he made about the c library as
</I>&gt;<i> well as some of the math library
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>choices. In particular his &quot;flong&quot; implementation, and I think he got his
&gt;<i> single precision math library from sdcc (small device c compiler). I
</I>&gt;<i> somewhat wish there were more detail (or sources :) but he does provide some
</I>&gt;<i> interesting pointers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I talked to Ralph, and it turns out that he chose the Minix libc too for
pbLua :)  So we're on the right track here. About the floating point
emulation library, I'm still looking for alternatives. The sdcc idea is
nice, thanks for that. But this is one area in which eLua and pbLua are
different. If I'm not mistaken, pbLua can't even be compiled with the number
type set to double, it's integer by default and uses a separate library for
floating point numbers (which is a nice idea and we'll have it too one day).
So our choice of a floating point emulation library might have to be
different. I worked on three floating point emulation libraries myself a
while ago, and I know how very tricky they can get, so we need to be
careful.

Best,
Bogdan
