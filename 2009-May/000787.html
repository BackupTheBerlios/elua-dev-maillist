</I>&gt;<i> Other ideas that I find interesting:

</I>&gt;<i> it remotely instead of throwing an error immediately
</I>&gt;<i> end_remote()
</I>&gt;<i> pio.set(1) -- this time we'll get an error
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This raises a number of interesting questions, like what happens if

</I>
Yeah, there are a lot of conceptual issues to consider there.  You  
could potentially make some of that bi-directional like if a remote  
call tries to find a but does not it can make a request back to the  
other end to get that variable.

I think the existing model needs to be adjusted to facilitate such  
back-and-forth behavor.

As far as the &quot;RPC if no local exists&quot; goes I think this would  
actually not be too hard to implement.  The way it works now is that  
you get a handle table when you open an rpc connection and doing an  
__index (used to be a gettable event) on entries in that table  
provides you with a helper (not sure why this double-layer is needed),  
and then you can call global functions through that helper.  I only  
have a __call metamethod on the helper so at the moment it only allows  
calling functions, but I should be able to adjust it to allow access  
to tables, numbers, etc..  I assume there's some global level call  
mechanism that could just be wrapped to check locally and then fall  
back to selected rpc handle if that fails.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - for RPC, you'd need a way to detect a failure on the transport and  
</I>&gt;<i> return this to the local caller; maybe by using the regular (nil,  
</I>&gt;<i> errormessage) Lua way.
</I>
It has exception handling for failures with the procedure calls  
themselves as well as the transport layer.  You can register a local  
error handler which gets an error message on, I think, both types of  
failure.  If you don't register one it comes back through a standard  
lua_error.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - how exactly do you plan on implementing the transport part? Will  
</I>&gt;<i> it be a separate &quot;thread&quot; running on both the PC and the eLua board,  
</I>&gt;<i> or will it block both of them by doing RPC only? For example, while  
</I>&gt;<i> you do RPC, will you be able to use the shell on the eLua side?  
</I>&gt;<i> Cause you need some kind of listener for your RPC calls.
</I>
There are two ways to handle this currently in LuaRPC. You can  
initialize a server with RPC_server, which is blocking and just waits  
on connections/calls.

Alternately you can do something like the following:

handle = RPC_listen (12345);
while 1 do
	if RPC_peek (handle) then
		RPC_dispatch (handle)
	end
end

So you can open up the socket and only deal with calls when they've  
already come in.

As far as how to initialize things in eLua my thought was along the  
lines of having an option to have it, by default, come up in an  
RPC_server mode on a given transport and wait for RPC calls.  This  
would be off by default.  Something more compatible with the default  
mode would be to have a command that could be issued at the shell like  
&quot;rpc&quot; or something with an argument related to what transport/port to  
use, and that would fire up the listener on elua on that port.  My  
thought on that front, for an initial implementation, is to just take  
over the connection that the shell was open on, sort of like how  
xmodem does, and that will stay in control until no longer needed.

One nice thing about this latter approach is that it would be pretty  
easy to set up the desktop-side of the connection to start the rpc  
connection from the terminal if needed so one needn't do that manually.

Now as far as concurrency is concerned, you can do that within a  
script using the listen, peek, dispatch approach.  I suppose some sort  
of green threading could also be done with our yet-to-be-implemented  
Lua interrupts.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - can we do this both ways ? :) I mean, since we can call eLua from  
</I>&gt;<i> PC, it will only be fair to eLua to let it call the PC. The PC has  
</I>&gt;<i> nothing on eLua :)
</I>
I think this could go further than the bidirectionality mentioned  
above, but it will require that both sides have listeners going for  
incoming RPC requests.  I presume that if, right now, one starts a  
server on different ports on each side of a connection that requests  
can go both ways as long as things are run in non-blocking mode.  It  
would be interesting to see what work might be needed to do bi- 
directional calls over a single connection.

&gt;<i> Must return to some inhumanly boring work now, but I'll come back  
</I>&gt;<i> when I have new ideas.
</I>
I have to do some of that too (mostly writing).

I also spent about 4 hours of yesterday, with students, explaining  
filtering, sampling while helping them debug their op-amp circuits,  
which I thought they had figured out the previous week :-)

I'll see what I get time for, but I think this should work pretty well  
with a bit of effort.
