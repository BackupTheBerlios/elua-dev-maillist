Yep, this is part of the idea, and is the next step I've started is  
separating out all the sockets stuff and adjusting the RPC code to use  
generic open/read/write/close functions that can be supplied by  
different transport layers.  I haven't decided exactly how I want to  
do it, but it would be nice to make it selectable when the RPC  
connection is initialized.  The existing code assumes the use of  
sockets, but it's got enough abstraction that making the interface  
generic shouldn't be too hard :-)

I'm open to suggestions on the model to use for the interface between  
the transport layer and the RPC layer.  Perhaps I'll take a look again  
at how the TCP/IP vs Serial terminal stuff is handled in eLua.

</I>
Interesting.  The existing module is built around two major things  
serializing lua data types and executing calls in a protected  
environment where errors can be custom-handled so that things get  
returned to the caller properly when things go south.

It should be possible to adapt things so that it'll work from the C  
layer as well, though, since the RPC layer just sends chunks of bytes,  
it might not be too hard to add a handling mechanism for that style of  
usage too.  I don't

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Lua API has gone through some interesting changes between 4.0.x  
</I>&gt;<i> and 5.1.x. I think I've mostly covered the bases as far as handling  
</I>&gt;<i> those differences, but the only testing I've done is with some  
</I>&gt;<i> examples provided by the original author.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hmmm. Anyone knows of a good test package for RPC systems? I don't.
</I>
Yeah, neither do I.  I think I may actually just do it by coming up  
with some unit tests for eLua and run them over RPC.  Obviously there  
are some differences and restrictions from running things locally, but  
if it works reasonably well for a range of behavior both locally and  
remotely, I would consider that acceptable.

There are some things that are more RPC specific, in terms of making  
sure it fails in the correct ways, but that could just be made  
optional for when being used in RPC mode.

I also like the idea of being able to run testing remotely with RPC  
since it means that there's a bit more flexibility for code to be used  
and for keeping track of results.  I don't like the idea of having an  
extra set of scripts for the romfs to do testing, that one has to  
decide whether or not to include, or having to send a large or  
multiple scripts over xmodem.
