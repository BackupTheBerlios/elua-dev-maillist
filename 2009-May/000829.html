<PRE>Hi,

I would like to integrate a _small_ script language into a _simple_ I/O device.
Some facts regarding the device:
 * CPU: STM32 (64k RAM, 512k ROM (hopefully))
 * no OS
 * no FS
 * no GUI
 * no terminal mode
 * just simple I/O PINs
 * communication with other devices via RS485

The customer should be able to read/write I/O Pins (comparable to a small SPS) and 
to communicate with other device (read/write parameters). This should be done with 
an easy script language.

First idea was to write a small script language on my own, but after some research, 
I decided to try Lua - even if it is much more powerful than my needs. I tried to 
get Lua 5.1.4 running, but it was not that easy as I thought. Main problem was the 
need for a filesystem, which is not avaialble.

eLua seems to solve my problem, and even more I got a filesystem, terminal mode,
and more. I haven't checked eLua until now, because I'm not sure if this is the 
right direction. I get more than I need, which have to be paid with ROM.

Do you think Lua | eLua is the right thing to put a small script language to a limited 
device? Do I have to use eLua (which is under GPL/BSD license)? Or should it be even 
possible to use &quot;plain&quot; Lua (which offers more flexible MIT license)?
As I wrote, I neither need a FS, GUI nor a terminal mode. Lua scripts are written to 
the device with a proprietary mechanism. Maximum length of Lua script is ~250 lines. 
At the end each LOC is stored in one separate string.

best regards

Joerg
