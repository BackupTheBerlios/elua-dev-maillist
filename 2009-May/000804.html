I agree.  Does the performance hit only show up during a GC (emergency  
or no)?  I've not clocked any of this yet.

In practice I would say since we have a fixed amount of memory, it's  
really undesirable to fail simply because a garbage collection event  
wasn't called in time.  The other side is that if the penalty is only  
at GC time, people could disable collection during time-critical  
operations.  I haven't taken a deep look to understand how every part  
of the patch works yet, but I see that it does provide a configurable  
of a memory limit.  Maybe another interesting tunable might be how  
many GC steps to take when an emergency GC is called (i.e.: just  
enough for the allocation pending, full gc, or something else?)  I'm  
also still curious about the idea of running GC in fixed timesteps,

In the interests of pragmatism, I don't think I'd pursue anything more  
detailed here unless I run up against some situation where it doesn't  
work as desired. I think, overall, a default of sane incremental  
collection (maybe with the GCPAUSE set to 110) and a backstop  
emergency GC should be a good solution for most cases.
