&gt;<i> I have a couple questions about the device manager and usage thereof:

</I>&gt;<i> 1.
</I>&gt;<i> In order to make LuaRPC fairly compatible with various transport layers we

</I>&gt;<i>  I've not really delved into how all of that is set up, but it looks like

</I>

There isn't really a &quot;transport layer&quot; there, the device manager only deals
with files in the traditional sense at the moment, so you can't have
something like &quot;/dev/tty0&quot; (like in Linux) and treat it just like another
file. Well, you could, but the interface is just too weak now I think. I
actually give some thought to the idea of having something like this in
eLua, but came to the conclusion that it isn't really worth the complexity
of the implementation. What I'd personally do is add another &quot;interface&quot; to
the platform interface.
I have to think about this more though. Not for the near future, but for the
long run. Having &quot;/dev/spix&quot; and &quot;/dev/uartx&quot; and &quot;talking&quot; to them via
read/write/ioctl like a regular file has a lot of advantages, as well as
some disadvantages. It sure seems tempting :)

Or should I have it work on a different level?  I think that the device
&gt;<i> manager functions should over the bases for what the RPC library needs
</I>&gt;<i> (pretty much just sending and receiving bytes).  It might be nice for it to
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;automatically&quot; work if a new new transport comes in so long as it conforms
</I>&gt;<i> to an interface standard.
</I>

Something like an automount daemon, if I got it right. eLua is getting some
file systems, so it should also get a &quot;mount&quot; command, and maybe even an
automount, but again, I'm not sure that the current implementation allows
for something more than just operations on regular file. It might though. It
definitely works on consoles :), but a RPC transpor is probably too much for
it. Even with desktop systems we have to use very different functions when
writing to a console and writing to sockets, for example. That's why I said
that I'd rather have some specialized functions in the platform interface
for this, rather than making the device manager (which is a pretentious name
for a very simple piece of code) much smarter than it is.

2.
&gt;<i> Are the devman and stubs the main things that are newlib specific?
</I>

Yes. And because of this it will change a lot when we give eLua its own
libc.

If one were thinking about working on top of another libc, where should one
&gt;<i> be focusing to need to find equivalent facilities in another C library?
</I>

There is already a branch in SVN on which I started to work on eLua with its
own libc, which is a modified (well, almost _unmodified_ at this point)
version of the Minix project's libc. Small, optimized for size, quite easy
to understand and released under BSD, that's all we need :) There is _a lot_
of work to be done there, some trivial, some not quite so (like deciding if
we also use the math emulation library from Minix (which I don't fully
understand yet) ), but I think we can go there. And once we do, the
advantages are huge IMO: complete portability, complete control over the
library and how it works (so we can implement our stubs however we wish),
reduced code size, (obviously) no more Newlib ... a dream come true :)

Best,
Bogdan
