<PRE>Hi Bogdan

I am feeling silly about my post now. Of course eLua runs on bare metal 
and not under an OS, DUH!

What I should have said, is &quot;could eLua run under an OS&quot; but having 
thought this through a little more, this is equally stupid. Why take a 
complex, feature rich code base and rip out features until your left 
with what... the ability to control 8 GPIO pins, an LED and maybe a 
TCP/IP stack? not an intelligent use of time...

So would this be sensible...

Assuming that these boards(Olimex/BeagleBoard/Raspberry PI etc) have C 
libraries for their limited peripherals, would it be sensible to write 
Lua bindings for them?

It could be a totally different code base but retain the same API, a 
sort of eLua-Lite.

Here is a bit of my workflow and logic(if it's okay to call it that!).

Using WebBuilder and CuteCom, I've written some simple blink like 
programs. I am sure WebBuilder can do much more then this and it's just 
my limited time that's the issue.....

I sometimes download other people's .BIN files. When I do, I have to 
copy them to a USB key, go downstairs, Boot up a Windoze 2000 machine 
and use the piece-o-sh*t, proprietary Luminary program to flash my board.

I have a JTAG pod on it's way and I hope to set up a cross compiler soon 
but so far in the limited time I have been able to spend on the project 
flashing has been an issue and adding C code to a project looks like it 
will take some time.

I was thinking that if eLua-Lite was as easy as installing a deb package 
or downloading from a repository, then someone could have an LED 
blinking in under a minute as eLua-Lite is already running on the 
target. Other features such as a cross compiler could be included as well.

Someone could play with the eLua like features and then start flashing a 
real target via JTAG right from the first board and then pretty soon 
just dump eLua-Lite and use the real thing.

The only benefit I see here is a lower barrier to entry but I think that 
is still worth something.

More logical? or should I get back to my crack pipe? :)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So enough rambling....I am planning on buying a Raspberry Pi for my son's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> project and it got me thinking about eLua.
</I>&gt;<i> I got a Raspberry coming my way too :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This device boots a full Linux desktop(LDXE). I was thinking that if I(or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> we) could rework a distro so that it ships with eLua, Nuccio's text editor,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> GCC, OpenOCD and any other useful tools, then it would provide a native
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> build environment for many of the boards the project targets, GCC on arm is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not a cross compiler!
</I>&gt;<i> You can't have a distribution with both eLua and GCC/OpenOCD. GCC
</I>&gt;<i> needs an OS (like Linux) to run on, eLua is itself a
</I>&gt;<i> mini-and-extremely-basic-OS (and you certainly won't be able to run
</I>&gt;<i> GCC on top of eLua :) ). You could probably find a virtualization
</I>&gt;<i> setup suitable for this task, but where's the fun in that? GCC on ARM
</I>&gt;<i> is indeed not a cross-compiler, but this isn't an issue at all. Cross
</I>&gt;<i> compilers make as good of a job as native compilers do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> With a jtag programmer preconfigured via OpenOCD and it could also make for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an easy environment to flash lighter weight ARM boards from.
</I>&gt;<i> This would be indeed an interesting project, but again, it would have
</I>&gt;<i> to run under Linux. While it's probably possible to make OpenOCD run
</I>&gt;<i> on bare metal, I can't see an advantage to this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If it had SSH and/or NFS installed then it could also be used in tandem with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a full power desktop. People could open remote directories for editing in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their desktop computers and initiate commands via SSH(like gcc).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This device also has 8 GPIO pins and could provide something to play with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> without the user having to be concerned about flashing at all.
</I>&gt;<i> And that's the main problem with this category of devices. They are
</I>&gt;<i> built around CPUs, not MCUs, so you loose the convenience of using
</I>&gt;<i> on-chip peripherals (like PWM, UARTs and so on) from the start. Sure,
</I>&gt;<i> you can add everything you need over USB and other interfaces, but at
</I>&gt;<i> that point it really doesn't make much sense to use the board as a
</I>&gt;<i> bare metal platform (working an USB drivers alone is a huge PITA). On
</I>&gt;<i> a somewhat related topic, don't even get me started on their extremely
</I>&gt;<i> bizarre NDA policy (I'm really struggling to keep a polite tone right
</I>&gt;<i> now). I refuse to work with manufacturers who release a CPU/MCU and
</I>&gt;<i> refuse to make the documentation public, as if you could do anything
</I>&gt;<i> at all with that chip without documentation (and actually getting the
</I>&gt;<i> documentation involves a lot of time, effort and maybe even lawyers)).
</I>&gt;<i> This simply doesn't make any sense at all in my engineerish mind and
</I>&gt;<i> thus I choose to not have anything to do with it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have a couple of concerns.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One the board is in short supply.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Two, just because it's a Debian/Fedora ARM build environment might not make
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it suitable for all ARM targets. I don't know how much the various ARMs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> differ?
</I>&gt;<i> You needn't worry about that. Cross compilers are available on all
</I>&gt;<i> Linux distros that I know of and they are very good at their job. The
</I>&gt;<i> ARMs can differ quite a bit, but that's for the compiler to worry
</I>&gt;<i> about (most of the time :) ).
</I>&gt;<i> All in all, I'd second Martin's oppinion: get a Mizar32 (or other
</I>&gt;<i> board that supports eLua), you're likely to get a much more pleasant
</I>&gt;<i> experience as far as eLua is concerned.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best,
</I>&gt;<i> Bogdan
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Any thoughts on this on this project-Patrick
