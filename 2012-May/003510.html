</I>Hi Martin

My time is not my own and as my business and family needs change, eLua 
is coming in and out of focus.

I am working on a project for my Son who has Autism. I have to complete 
it but all the technical details are worked out. It's a talking keyboard 
that works as an assistive speech device. It's a QWERTY keyboard but 
there are news key symbols on top, there is a key for the &quot;SH&quot; sound for 
instance.

Anyhow, I want to make a portable version of it. It's basically a 
desktop application, it uses gstreamer.

Using one of these Linux capable boards will make it portable.

Having some GPIO lines could be fun too. I could also make some 
iterative games with just 8 lines and an led screen.

I wanted to use eLua for some firmware hacking on the scientific 
instruments I have here for my work but they are all based on 16 bit 
CPUs and the few that are microcontroller based are not 32 bit.

My Son's project is too heavy for a microcontroller, unless someone 
knows of an audio library that could be embedded on an eLua supported 
target?

My work and family needs are not a good match for eLua right now but I 
would like to help with the project if there is anything that meshes.

Thanks

BTW I am desperately short of time and unlikely to be of much help but I 
would be willing to buy some Mizar gear, stock it here and ship it to 
your customers. You could then replace my purchases that I shipped out. 
I don't ship everyday and can't make special trips to my UPS store for 
this but if the end user can tolerate a 3-4 day wait time before 
shipment, I could do this.

Probably much faster then waiting for postal service from Italy or 
paying for trans-Atlantic courier service though...
