<PRE>It depends on what you need to do on the audio side. Playing stuff? 
Audio processing? Mixing? Filters? If you need to simply play stuff, you 
have a range of options; for example, letting the MCU do all the playing 
or using a small, relatively cheap, easy to use MP3 decoder IC for your 
playback. if you need audio processing, you still might be able to do 
that (with a M4 core for example), but you might end up needing to use a 
DSP. It all depends on your requirements. Best, Bogdan


Sorry to everyone, this is barely on topic or not at all........


Hi Bogdan

I was following up on Tony's helpful suggestion about Blackfin/TI but 
having an IC that could solve this would be even more flexible.

So the needs are fairly modest and I hate using gstreamer for this.

I need to be able to play back a 40 second audio file but I have to be 
able to seek and pause and latency is very important.

I haven't finished the work, but believe it or not, the 40 second file 
will have taken about 3 straight days of work to produce. I have 
recorded my own speech and I am dividing it into it's smallest building 
blocks, phonemes. The phonemes are split throughout the file and I need 
to be able to precisely seek to them.

Using a bunch of drawings I hope to teach my Son how to talk by giving 
him visual aids on how to pronounce words:
Imagine a picture of a phone and I prompt him like this:

This is how we spell
phone
but this is how to say it
f&#333;n

The program need to be able to seek to the &quot;f&quot; sound, play it, seek to 
the &quot;&#333;&quot; sound play it and then see to the &quot;n&quot; sound and play it as he 
types these keys, yes &quot;&#333;&quot; will have it's own key.

My theory is that languages such as English, that have poor 
correspondence between spelling and actual pronunciation are 
complicating the recovery of people suffering from Autism. My Son is 6 
now and is reading fairly well but still has very limited speech. He 
can't learn the language by listening alone and our writing system is 
seriously screwed.

if we were in Romania, I wouldn't need to attempt this project:

<A HREF="http://www.unilang.org/wiki/index.php/Romanian_orthography">http://www.unilang.org/wiki/index.php/Romanian_orthography</A>

The same is largely true with Portuguese and Italian and several other 
languages.

Thanks for your hints on this and feedback on my nutty R PI idea.
</PRE>
