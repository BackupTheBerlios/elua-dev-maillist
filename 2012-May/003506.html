<PRE>Hi Patrick,

Sorry to hear that :( I wish the best of luck to you and your daughter.

</I>&gt;<i> I hope to resume the screencast tutorials I started(or &#160;barely

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So enough rambling....I am planning on buying a Raspberry Pi for my son's
</I>&gt;<i> project and it got me thinking about eLua.
</I>
I got a Raspberry coming my way too :)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This device boots a full Linux desktop(LDXE). I was thinking that if I(or
</I>&gt;<i> we) could rework a distro so that it ships with eLua, Nuccio's text editor,
</I>&gt;<i> GCC, OpenOCD and any other useful tools, then it would provide a native
</I>&gt;<i> build environment for many of the boards the project targets, GCC on arm is
</I>&gt;<i> not a cross compiler!
</I>
You can't have a distribution with both eLua and GCC/OpenOCD. GCC
needs an OS (like Linux) to run on, eLua is itself a
mini-and-extremely-basic-OS (and you certainly won't be able to run
GCC on top of eLua :) ). You could probably find a virtualization
setup suitable for this task, but where's the fun in that? GCC on ARM
is indeed not a cross-compiler, but this isn't an issue at all. Cross
compilers make as good of a job as native compilers do.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With a jtag programmer preconfigured via OpenOCD and it could also make for
</I>&gt;<i> an easy environment to flash lighter weight ARM boards from.
</I>
This would be indeed an interesting project, but again, it would have
to run under Linux. While it's probably possible to make OpenOCD run
on bare metal, I can't see an advantage to this.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If it had SSH and/or NFS installed then it could also be used in tandem with
</I>&gt;<i> a full power desktop. People could open remote directories for editing in
</I>&gt;<i> their desktop computers and initiate commands via SSH(like gcc).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This device also has 8 GPIO pins and could provide something to play with
</I>&gt;<i> without the user having to be concerned about flashing at all.
</I>
And that's the main problem with this category of devices. They are
built around CPUs, not MCUs, so you loose the convenience of using
on-chip peripherals (like PWM, UARTs and so on) from the start. Sure,
you can add everything you need over USB and other interfaces, but at
that point it really doesn't make much sense to use the board as a
bare metal platform (working an USB drivers alone is a huge PITA). On
a somewhat related topic, don't even get me started on their extremely
bizarre NDA policy (I'm really struggling to keep a polite tone right
now). I refuse to work with manufacturers who release a CPU/MCU and
refuse to make the documentation public, as if you could do anything
at all with that chip without documentation (and actually getting the
documentation involves a lot of time, effort and maybe even lawyers)).
This simply doesn't make any sense at all in my engineerish mind and
thus I choose to not have anything to do with it.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have a couple of concerns.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One the board is in short supply.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Two, just because it's a Debian/Fedora ARM build environment might not make
</I>&gt;<i> it suitable for all ARM targets. I don't know how much the various ARMs
</I>&gt;<i> differ?
</I>
You needn't worry about that. Cross compilers are available on all
Linux distros that I know of and they are very good at their job. The
ARMs can differ quite a bit, but that's for the compiler to worry
about (most of the time :) ).
All in all, I'd second Martin's oppinion: get a Mizar32 (or other
board that supports eLua), you're likely to get a much more pleasant
experience as far as eLua is concerned.

Best,
Bogdan
