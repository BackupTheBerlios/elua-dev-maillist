<PRE>Hi Guys

The past few months have been difficult. It looks like daughter is also 
about to be diagnosed with Autism. The project I have been working on 
for my Son looked easier as a desktop solution, so I've ignored 
everything embedded. Now it looks viable as embedded and i am back 
again. i need to follow along with what is best for my kids and my 
business, i haven't been able to do anything just for my own interest.

I hope to resume the screencast tutorials I started(or  barely 
started)earlier in the year, sorry about the interruption.


So enough rambling....I am planning on buying a Raspberry Pi for my 
son's project and it got me thinking about eLua.

This device boots a full Linux desktop(LDXE). I was thinking that if 
I(or we) could rework a distro so that it ships with eLua, Nuccio's text 
editor, GCC, OpenOCD and any other useful tools, then it would provide a 
native build environment for many of the boards the project targets, GCC 
on arm is not a cross compiler!

With a jtag programmer preconfigured via OpenOCD and it could also make 
for an easy environment to flash lighter weight ARM boards from.

If it had SSH and/or NFS installed then it could also be used in tandem 
with a full power desktop. People could open remote directories for 
editing in their desktop computers and initiate commands via SSH(like gcc).

This device also has 8 GPIO pins and could provide something to play 
with without the user having to be concerned about flashing at all.

I have a couple of concerns.

One the board is in short supply.

Two, just because it's a Debian/Fedora ARM build environment might not 
make it suitable for all ARM targets. I don't know how much the various 
ARMs differ?

Any thoughts on this on this project-Patrick
</PRE>
