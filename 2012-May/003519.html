<PRE>Then, come to Romania. Here is much more interactivity between people
and children. You have where to let children play safe and they can do
wonders. In a place at countryside, with lot of people, children,
animals and birds, with lot of activity and play time, with joys and
surprises, events and an wonderful natural environment I bet your
child can recover in no time.
I wish him all the best.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Bogdan
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was following up on Tony's helpful suggestion about Blackfin/TI but
</I>&gt;<i> having an IC that could solve this would be even more flexible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So the needs are fairly modest and I hate using gstreamer for this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I need to be able to play back a 40 second audio file but I have to be
</I>&gt;<i> able to seek and pause and latency is very important.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I haven't finished the work, but believe it or not, the 40 second file
</I>&gt;<i> will have taken about 3 straight days of work to produce. I have
</I>&gt;<i> recorded my own speech and I am dividing it into it's smallest building
</I>&gt;<i> blocks, phonemes. The phonemes are split throughout the file and I need
</I>&gt;<i> to be able to precisely seek to them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Using a bunch of drawings I hope to teach my Son how to talk by giving
</I>&gt;<i> him visual aids on how to pronounce words:
</I>&gt;<i> Imagine a picture of a phone and I prompt him like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is how we spell
</I>&gt;<i> phone
</I>&gt;<i> but this is how to say it
</I>&gt;<i> f&#333;n
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The program need to be able to seek to the &quot;f&quot; sound, play it, seek to
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;&#333;&quot; sound play it and then see to the &quot;n&quot; sound and play it as he
</I>&gt;<i> types these keys, yes &quot;&#333;&quot; will have it's own key.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My theory is that languages such as English, that have poor
</I>&gt;<i> correspondence between spelling and actual pronunciation are
</I>&gt;<i> complicating the recovery of people suffering from Autism. My Son is 6
</I>&gt;<i> now and is reading fairly well but still has very limited speech. He
</I>&gt;<i> can't learn the language by listening alone and our writing system is
</I>&gt;<i> seriously screwed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> if we were in Romania, I wouldn't need to attempt this project:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The same is largely true with Portuguese and Italian and several other
</I>&gt;<i> languages.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your hints on this and feedback on my nutty R PI idea.
