</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>

Sure. A module could be installable as a regular lua rock (package).  
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It could be a totally different code base but retain the same API, a 
</I>&gt;<i> sort of eLua-Lite.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here is a bit of my workflow and logic(if it's okay to call it that!).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Using WebBuilder and CuteCom, I've written some simple blink like 
</I>&gt;<i> programs. I am sure WebBuilder can do much more then this and it's just 
</I>&gt;<i> my limited time that's the issue.....
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I sometimes download other people's .BIN files. When I do, I have to 
</I>&gt;<i> copy them to a USB key, go downstairs, Boot up a Windoze 2000 machine 
</I>&gt;<i> and use the piece-o-sh*t, proprietary Luminary program to flash my board.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
It is possible to use openocd though it could be easier and I think our instructions need updating. Also, my personal solution for flashing when all-else-fails under anything but windows is a VM in virtual box which generally has worked well, though is an annoying crutch it's a bit better than firing up old hardware especially with shared drive access. 
 
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have a JTAG pod on it's way and I hope to set up a cross compiler soon 
</I>&gt;<i> but so far in the limited time I have been able to spend on the project 
</I>&gt;<i> flashing has been an issue and adding C code to a project looks like it 
</I>&gt;<i> will take some time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
The luminary board should also have a built-in ftdi-based jtag interface, which is what the windows flash tool uses. 
 
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was thinking that if eLua-Lite was as easy as installing a deb package 
</I>&gt;<i> or downloading from a repository, then someone could have an LED 
</I>&gt;<i> blinking in under a minute as eLua-Lite is already running on the 
</I>&gt;<i> target. Other features such as a cross compiler could be included as well.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>

Sure.  
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Someone could play with the eLua like features and then start flashing a 
</I>&gt;<i> real target via JTAG right from the first board and then pretty soon 
</I>&gt;<i> just dump eLua-Lite and use the real thing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The only benefit I see here is a lower barrier to entry but I think that 
</I>&gt;<i> is still worth something.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> More logical? or should I get back to my crack pipe? :)
</I>Sure. We do actually have a sort of &quot;simulator&quot; build that runs on x86. But it's really rudimentary and doesn't really talk to hardware at all. If I recall it might even be somewhat sandboxed because it still uses newlib. 

I think building a lua HAL on top of Lua that matches eLua's API would make a nice platform for testing and perhaps building projects, and adds another platform that code written for eLua could work on.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Hi Guys
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The past few months have been difficult. It looks like daughter is also
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; about to be diagnosed with Autism.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sorry to hear that :( I wish the best of luck to you and your daughter.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The project I have been working on for my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Son looked easier as a desktop solution, so I've ignored everything
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; embedded. Now it looks viable as embedded and i am back again. i need to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; follow along with what is best for my kids and my business, i haven't been
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; able to do anything just for my own interest.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I hope to resume the screencast tutorials I started(or barely
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; started)earlier in the year, sorry about the interruption.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; So enough rambling....I am planning on buying a Raspberry Pi for my son's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; project and it got me thinking about eLua.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I got a Raspberry coming my way too :)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; This device boots a full Linux desktop(LDXE). I was thinking that if I(or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; we) could rework a distro so that it ships with eLua, Nuccio's text editor,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; GCC, OpenOCD and any other useful tools, then it would provide a native
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; build environment for many of the boards the project targets, GCC on arm is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; not a cross compiler!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You can't have a distribution with both eLua and GCC/OpenOCD. GCC
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; needs an OS (like Linux) to run on, eLua is itself a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mini-and-extremely-basic-OS (and you certainly won't be able to run
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; GCC on top of eLua :) ). You could probably find a virtualization
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; setup suitable for this task, but where's the fun in that? GCC on ARM
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is indeed not a cross-compiler, but this isn't an issue at all. Cross
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; compilers make as good of a job as native compilers do.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; With a jtag programmer preconfigured via OpenOCD and it could also make for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; an easy environment to flash lighter weight ARM boards from.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This would be indeed an interesting project, but again, it would have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to run under Linux. While it's probably possible to make OpenOCD run
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on bare metal, I can't see an advantage to this.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; If it had SSH and/or NFS installed then it could also be used in tandem with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; a full power desktop. People could open remote directories for editing in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; their desktop computers and initiate commands via SSH(like gcc).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; This device also has 8 GPIO pins and could provide something to play with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; without the user having to be concerned about flashing at all.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And that's the main problem with this category of devices. They are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; built around CPUs, not MCUs, so you loose the convenience of using
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on-chip peripherals (like PWM, UARTs and so on) from the start. Sure,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you can add everything you need over USB and other interfaces, but at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that point it really doesn't make much sense to use the board as a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bare metal platform (working an USB drivers alone is a huge PITA). On
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a somewhat related topic, don't even get me started on their extremely
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bizarre NDA policy (I'm really struggling to keep a polite tone right
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; now). I refuse to work with manufacturers who release a CPU/MCU and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; refuse to make the documentation public, as if you could do anything
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; at all with that chip without documentation (and actually getting the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; documentation involves a lot of time, effort and maybe even lawyers)).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This simply doesn't make any sense at all in my engineerish mind and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thus I choose to not have anything to do with it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I have a couple of concerns.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; One the board is in short supply.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Two, just because it's a Debian/Fedora ARM build environment might not make
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; it suitable for all ARM targets. I don't know how much the various ARMs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; differ?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You needn't worry about that. Cross compilers are available on all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Linux distros that I know of and they are very good at their job. The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ARMs can differ quite a bit, but that's for the compiler to worry
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; about (most of the time :) ).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; All in all, I'd second Martin's oppinion: get a Mizar32 (or other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; board that supports eLua), you're likely to get a much more pleasant
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; experience as far as eLua is concerned.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Best,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Bogdan
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Any thoughts on this on this project-Patrick
