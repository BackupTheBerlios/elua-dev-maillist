Verbose? I aimed for the minimum of cruft and limiting the interface
to the essential information.

&gt;<i> The interface on my branch ( I think Bogdan wrote it for str9 ) is a bit

</I>&gt;<i> That is,
</I>&gt;<i> mbed.rtc.gettime(&quot;*t&quot;) returns a table with the fields hour, min, sec
</I>&gt;<i> mbed.rtc.gettime(&quot;*s&quot;) returns a string formated as HH:MM:SS
</I>&gt;<i> mbed.rtc.getdate(&quot;*t&quot;) returns a table with the fields year, month, day
</I>&gt;<i> mbed.rtc.getdate(&quot;*s&quot;) returns a string formated as DD/MM/YYYY
</I>
I saw this, and couldn't bring myself to use it because it has two defects:
1. You can't set the date and time in a single call, and making two
calls sets the date wrong by a day at midnight when 00:00:00 falls
between the calls. Time-and-date-setting (and reading) needs to be a
single atomic operation
2. DD/MM/YYYY is MM/DD/YYYY in the USA, so you can't write code
without knowing the date-printing conventions in your
internationalization locale, which is not something that eLua does
because the tables of info for it to work is huge, the same as the
daylight time stuff, unless you do this at compile-time to produce
i18n-zone-specific firmware, again something I would prefer to avoid
if possible.

&gt;<i> The set functions setdate and settime can receive a table with those fields
</I>&gt;<i> or a string in that same format.
</I>&gt;<i> I could add day of week as Lua have, but str9 has no support for the day of
</I>&gt;<i> year...
</I>
Our clocks don't have DOY either (and shouldn't as it's a value
derived from other fields.
I have a short magic formula somewhere that will calculate it if you
need it for some reason.
Actually, DOW is redundant too, but both Lua and the hardware have it,
so i just pass it on.
Presumably a hypothetical clock with a DOY register could take note of
that field if present, and return it, but it looks like a non-problem
to me at present

&gt;<i> In the alarm part the case is a bit more complicated as the str9 alarm only
</I>&gt;<i> have the hour, min, sec and day of month fields, while the mbed has full
</I>&gt;<i> date and time support.
</I>
That's easy - just ignore fields that the hardware does not support.

&gt;<i> For now, I left different APIs for the alarm, as I have no idea how to unify
</I>&gt;<i> that.
</I>
I see not a lot has changed in eLua-API-discussion world!  :)
