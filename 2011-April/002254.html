This is an interesting discussion/point.  Lua certainly provides some
mechanisms for complaining about this sort of thing, and being able to
toggle this, or maybe even make it default to be on during interactive
use and default off otherwise would be quite desirable.

However, I think there's also some question as to _how_ and _when_ one
would and should warn the user about such things.  Clearly one wants
to warn the user about potentially unexpected or undesirable behavior,
but where does one draw the line for this sort of thing. This is a
problem with most of the platform modules, and is particularly the
case with ADC where setting the &quot;clock&quot; for one channel, generally
means setting it for all the channels since they're all multiplexed,
but do I warn the user of that every time?

Perhaps there could be some pattern for functions like this that have
side effects to not only return frequency that was set on the stack,
but also a list of the peripheral ids that were affected or something
similar?

We could also go in the direction of having a general facility, which
might actually be necessary in order to implement the warning system
in the first place, whereby the user would be able to check in advance
what groups would be affected by certain settings or changes on a
given platform.

When we come upon details like this, I think we hit some difficult
questions (much more so than just implementing a new peripheral module
or general feature) of how to keep something like this simple and
usable without ballooning into something the size of the USB or ACPI
spec :-)

I, and I suspect Bogdan as well, really like the idea of describing
the platform, pin configurations and whatnot in a machine digestible
form both for the build system and for online documentation as well as
situations like this where the system would be able to provide useful
warnings if the user desired.  I'm also unsure how to prevent
something like this from becoming too resource intensive on an MCU
(aside from maybe optionally storing such information with
documentation on an SD card where the user could enable a flag to turn
on checking that would have an overhead cost).

Another thought could be this:  if the overhead is too high on the MCU
and we do have the MCU described in some sort of data structure, we
could provide some sort of eLua-lint that could be run on the desktop
that would spit out some platform-relevant warnings for the user?
