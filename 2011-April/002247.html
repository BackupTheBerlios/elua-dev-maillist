</I>
Thanks for the thought. In fact, the AVR32 PWM has some extra stuff
that people might need:
- alignment: left-aligned waveform or centred (symmetrical) waveform
- polarity: each cycle starts low then goes high, or starts hight then goes low
- generating an interrupt at the end of each cycle of a waveform
which I guess are not portable between platforms.
However, for now I'm just trying to get something that works at all.
These platform-specific refinements can happen in a second moment.

Conversely, if some but not all of the platforms support some feature,
say centre-aligned waveforms, then do we end up with
at91.pwm.alignment() avr32.pwm.alignment() and
other_board.pwm.alignment()?

In the specific case we are talking about here, the API change to
start/stop (/configure?) several PWM outputs in one call seems
orthogonal to the other modules, as well as being a more convenient
syntax, and if a platform can't do it in reality, it can just start
several channels in a for loop in C, which will stil be more closely
aligned than doing it with a for loop in Lua.

&gt;<i> As Bogdan has mentioned, we don't mind (too much :) changing the API to
</I>&gt;<i> support better models, even if this breaks some code and this is why we
</I>&gt;<i> haven't called any of our versions a eLua 1.0 yet.
</I>
Sometimes the API needs redesigning (or refining) in the light of
practical experience, but given the small amount of code already
written for eLua, we should be able to do this without too much pain.
It's kinder to users if we ensure that existing code that uses the old
interface either continues working with some legacy interface, or
fails to compile with an error.

&gt;<i> But this should be done very carefully, not only to support one very used
</I>&gt;<i> platform but to make sure the changes will bring benefits to all. If not
</I>&gt;<i> possible, there will always be the handy solution of creating
</I>&gt;<i> platform-specific modules.
</I>
Of course, although the API already contains stuff that cannot be
implemented on all platforms.
For example, the PWM interface thinks you can set the clock frequency
independently for each channel, both at the Lua level and the C
interface:
but none of the platforms can do this.  Changing the clock of one
channel changes it for all of the others (or &quot;some of the others&quot; in
the AT91 case!) - something users need to be aware of while writing
for a specific platform.

Already, platform-independent code is difficult in eLua.  Look at
led.lua for example.
