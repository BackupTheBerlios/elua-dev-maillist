Then simply don't check for them. Just look at the warnings issued from the
system and wonder &quot;what the f**k is this supposed to mean anyway?&quot; :)

Right. So every time anyone sets a clock speed, it will always tell
&gt;<i> them that it has also changed the clock speed of the other channels.
</I>&gt;<i> And every time they set an output frequency &gt;1000Hz it will print a
</I>&gt;<i> warning that the output frequency is imprecise.  That means spewing
</I>&gt;<i> always!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Sure, but presumtively setting a clock speed is not something one does very
often. Plus, I remind you that this is a feature which is supposed to be
helpful mainly in the _prototyping_ phase. I for one would welcome a bit of
help from my system while prototyping. In any case, there are ways to fix
this:

1. turn off warnings completely
2. turn off warnings for the PWM module only
3. turn off only that specific warning (probably wasteful to implement in
terms of memory).
4. associate levels to warnings and inhibit specific module/warning level
combinations (not as powerful as 4 but less resource demanding)
5. set a warning filter (a set of Lua regexps)

And probably many others :)
By the way, I don't have anything against turning all the warnings off by
default.


&gt;<i> &gt; Actually, as I think about this, I think that warnings like this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should probably be off by default
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here we agree. I guess that mean different compiles of the firmware:
</I>&gt;<i> firmware with debug/warning/educational messages and without.
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see a way to turn it on/off au runtime from the same firmware
</I>&gt;<i> if you want the device to start on power on
</I>&gt;<i> How about a new Lua module with warning.enable() and
</I>&gt;<i> warning.disable()?  Or better, put it inside the module &quot;elua&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> elua.warnings = true (or non-nil?) to enable them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
My original proposal included exactly something like this inside the elua
module.


&gt;<i> While developing code you can easily add a line to do this at the
</I>&gt;<i> start of the first file.
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, I still need it under a compile-time flag for my precious 120KB.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You'll be able to load it as a module eventually :) Not sure how much it
would help in this particular case though.


&gt;<i> &gt; Heisenberg turn in his grave :-)
</I>&gt;<i> Yes,  &quot;Theory&quot; means &quot;something that is not relevant to practice&quot; ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You have spoken like a true engineer :)


&gt;<i> I love those days when I can delete hundreds of lines of code.
</I>&gt;<i> It feels good.  I vote we kill pio.decode() today

INT_GPIO_POSEDGE and INT_GPIO_NEGEDGE are called with an argument which is a
(pio,port) combination (code). There is a single interrupt handler for each
of these interrupts, so if you remove pio.decode() and you want to know
which port generated the interrupt you'll have no way of doing that (at
least not without issuing a lot of comparisons).
I vaguely remember using it in a non-interrupt related context but I can't
remember the details.

Best,
Bogdan
