</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Sorry, I simply don't agree that &quot;ease of use&quot; precludes &quot;power&quot;. The first
example that immediately comes to mind is Xcode under OS/X. I believe that
simplicity and power can co-exist, at least up to a point which is very much
ahead of what we have in eLua right now.


&gt;<i> If people want to be able to express themselves with precision, they
</I>&gt;<i> need a larger vocabulary, so need to understand more.
</I>&gt;<i> If you understand less, the range of concepts that you can express is
</I>&gt;<i> smaller.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Absolutely correct. I fail to see the connection though. I feel like you're
still talking about APIs and I'm still talking about warning messages. I'm
with you on the API front.


&gt;<i> The thing to avoid is making a  system that is difficult to use and
</I>&gt;<i> still gives you no power. Think MS-DOS command.com
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Computers are the most complex machines ever built, and creating the
</I>&gt;<i> illusion of simplicity is what programming is all about.
</I>&gt;<i> You do this by hiding the immense underlying complexity, which you do
</I>&gt;<i> by making decisions for the users and doing &quot;the right thing&quot; without
</I>&gt;<i> bothering them.
</I>&gt;<i> How successful you are in doing this determines how easy your product
</I>&gt;<i> is to use, and the goal is the same whether you are aiming at
</I>&gt;<i> high-level or low-level users.
</I>&gt;<i> The Linux device drivers are high-complexity because they give wide
</I>&gt;<i> expressive power to their callers, but they still hide everything else
</I>&gt;<i> that is not relevant.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A flood of warning messages exposes complexity instead of hiding it.
</I>&gt;<i> Think of a Windows machine where there is a constant flow of
</I>&gt;<i> distracting boxes popping up with incomprehensible messages in them.
</I>&gt;<i> No user likes that, whether naive or advanced. It confuses the naive
</I>&gt;<i> ones and annoys the advanced ones.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Ah, this is a problem of perspective then. I agree with you in most cases,
but not always. While _developing_ a program I personally find the message
boxes extremely useful. Moreover, I found myself reading the Windows debug
logs more than once in an attempt to find bugs. It was helpful on many
ocasions. And when I didn't want it anymore, I just closed it. Linux has a
generic logging facility which you can control however you like and it
doesn't have to stay in front of your eyes at all times. What I'm trying to
achieve is exactly something between these lines.


&gt;<i> &gt; the warnings themselves shouldn't have any influence on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the actual functionality.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Printing an error message IS a change in functionality.
</I>&gt;<i> If an application changes the duty cycle once per cycle (like the
</I>&gt;<i> crude DAC example), the flood of error messages to print on the serisl
</I>&gt;<i> port will slow the system to a crawl.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Absolutely correct. This is why you'll most likely decide not to use them
after the prototyping phase. As I see it, the flow is like this:

1. you write your program
2. you get one or more warnings
3. you fix them and mask them if needed so they don't interfere with your
work anymore
4. repeat from step 1 until your program works. At this point you can
disable warnings completely.

When the warnings are disabled, what you're left with is the overhead of
calling the warning system functions. I believe that's mostly negligeable in
a system built around an interpreted language.


&gt;<i> If they are controlling some device on the serial port, a warning
</I>&gt;<i> message will come out in the middle of their protocol.
</I>&gt;<i> At present, a running eLua program never writes anything to the UART
</I>&gt;<i> unless you ask it to.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
And it won't issue a warning if you tell it not to :)


&gt;<i> An observer ALWAYS modifies the system it observes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Which is extremely important if you want to talk about quantum physics,
Heisenberg's principle and related topics. Not that much in this particular
and very practical situation :)


&gt;<i> Unobtrusive observation, even though it is one of the dogmas of naive
</I>&gt;<i> scientists, is impossible. Even serious physicists have now woken up
</I>&gt;<i> to this.
</I>

I suspected tha the discussion might be headed in this direction :) Again:
you're perfectly right in theory. In practice though, in the particular case
of eLua, I believe this is a non-issue.

It's one of the fallacies of scientific method (the other one is that
&gt;<i> you can recreate the same initial state to repeat the same
</I>&gt;<i> experiment).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Linux device drivers are a very different world from a programming
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; system for beginners, so the policy there (of not enforcing one way of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; driving a peripheral, but of having a complex programmer interface
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; that allows the caller to set the device up with as much precision and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; flexibility as possible) is made according to the world of Linux
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; device drivers.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sure. It's a good generic principle though and I'm trying to follow it as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; much as I can.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Don't do that if you want your system to be easy to use.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I do want it to be easy to use, but remember the &quot;power' aspect.
Equilibrium, this is what it's all about (no, not the movie). One can't have
everything. I won't pretend for a second that I know how to find this
equilibrium, but at least I'm trying :)


&gt;<i> An expressive interface is complex, and a complex interface is more
</I>&gt;<i> difficult to use.
</I>&gt;<i> A simple interface is easy to use, but a simple interface doesn't let
</I>&gt;<i> you do much.
</I>&gt;<i> Choosing the right level of complexity/expressiveness in an interface
</I>&gt;<i> is an important choice, but it is still a choice. If you don't make
</I>&gt;<i> that choice consciously, the simple interface will grow lots of extra
</I>&gt;<i> methods to perform advanced tasks... which is what is happening to
</I>&gt;<i> eLua.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It's a bit more complex than that in  eLua as we have the additional
platform independce requirement. It's fairly easy to write an interface that
use all the capabilities of a certain peripheral on a certain platform, it's
much harder to generalize. And even after you're done generalizing you're
still left with pieces of platform-specific funtionality that can only be
implemented by a certain platform.


&gt;<i> If you try to make it both complex and simple, both powerful and easy
</I>&gt;<i> to use, you are trying to resolve a paradox and are certain not to
</I>&gt;<i> succeed.
</I>
Of course, in the attempt to do the impossible, you may achieve
&gt;<i> enlightenment :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

</I>
Best,
Bogdan
