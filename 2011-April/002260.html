Ah, OK. We have different objectives then.
In a toy system for beginners, I suppose holding their hands and
popping up with info boxs on simple errors may be useful to people who
don't have a good grasp of what they are doing..
I aim for a production-quality system that permits you to drive the
hardware with precision to achieve quality results.
Of course, these two objectives are not mutually exclusive.

However, the objectives *do* conflict when it comes to something like
the difference between being able to set the duty cycle roughly in
percent or getting the maximum available precision, in which case you
need to be able to find out the period in cycles and set it to a
number of cycles.  If you just want to dim LEDs and don't mind the
dimming being visibly stepped at low values, percent is OK. If you
want to use PWM as a crude DAC, percent reduces it to being slightly
worse than a 7-bit DAC whereas the hardware (in this case) is capable
of 1 in 1000 precision at 11kHz - a little better than telephone
quality.

Yes, I know there's an issue proposing a higher precision of PWM duty
cycle specification, though I expect it will be to set it as a
fraction of a million, like the delays.  The most precise primitive
would be to be able to find out the period in clock cycles and to set
the duty period in clock cycles, but from what you say that seems
inappropriate to the eLua way of thinking.

&gt;&gt;<i> Another example I noticed in passing: if you ask for an SPI clock rate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that is not supported, the code selects the arithmetically closest
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> available clock rate, which may be higher, so if you try to initialise
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a device at its maximum rated transfer speed, the code can select a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> higher one that is out of spec.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> IMO this is exactly the kind of situation where a warning could make things
</I>&gt;<i> much better. You set your clock in the program, eLua says &quot;hey, i can't give
</I>&gt;<i> you that, i'm going to setup something a bit higher&quot;
</I>
Or you (as the implementer) can know that SPI clocks tend to be chosen
to drive devices at their maximum rated speed, and select an available
speed that is as high as possible without exceeding the specified
speed, while UART baud rates need to be as close to the requested rate
as possible so that the communication is more likely to work, and PWM
frequencies are more likely to be used to generate an audio tone or ti
signal devices that respond to PWM signals, so are probably best
chosen as close to the requested value as possible.  That also seems
best for beginners, since their SPI device is more likely to work and
their piano is more likely to be well tuned. (Currently the strategies
are exactly the opposite to this!)
However, it's well documented that the primitives return the actual
speed selected (or, rather a number close to the actual value!), so
power programmers can check that to see what really happened and
correct if necessary.

My feeling is that issuing a warning is a solution to the programmer
anxiety that arises when you can't do exactly what was asked and can't
decide what would be right. Dumping the problem on the user is one
solution, to make them decide. Another is to make a policy decision
(for example, if a requested value is higher or lower than the
possible values, set the highest or lowest possible, and if it cannot
be precisely obtained, set the arithmetically closest value, or the
nearest available lower value or whatever).
Issuing a warning when the value is not precise creates the question
&quot;How much imprecision is not precise?&quot; More than an integer different?
That will throw errors all the time. More than 10% different?  Or 5%?
Why 5? Why 10? Do we need another primitive to set the imprecision
that triggers warnings?
OK, I'm exaggerating to make a point, but there is a risk that it just
replaces a technical problem with a philosophical one and unless
someone wants to go through all the existing code looking for places
where a warning might be useful to a beginner, I can predict that the
warning support will be not be consistent, but just limited to a few
cases where the programmer thought it might be useful.

Still, when working on mainline eLua, I'll try to implement stuff as
close to the eLua way as possible.
