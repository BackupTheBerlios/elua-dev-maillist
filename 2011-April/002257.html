<PRE>-1 for warning messages, partly because eLua is for embedded systems
so should be essential, and partly because &quot;the users&quot; are embedded
systems engineers who do need to be familiar with the characteristics
of device they are using, and need to know how to use eLua to achieve
the exact effects they require. in short, they need good
documentation.


We can help them (and ourselves!) in this by documenting what the
modules/platforms actually do with much more precision and detail
(think of the precision of a datasheet: waveform characteristics,
timing behaviour, mandatory initialization/use sequences of the
primitives, bugs/defects in some scenarios) and we can make this task
easier and more comprehensible by making the different ports behave in
more similar ways.

Let me give an example: I couldn't find out what the behaviour of a
PWM should be and don't have the other hardware platforms to be able
to compare them so have just had to guess while implementing it for
AVR32 and the result is the following:
- each channel's pin is not driven until pwm.start() is called for it,
at which point it becomes a driven output
- after pwm.setup(), the output remains low (GND) until pwm.start() is called
- it always outputs a complete number of cycles even if you call
pwm.stop() immediately
- you can call pwm.start() before pwm.setup() if you like and it still works
- the actual frequency differs from the required frequency and is
always &gt;= the requested frequency. The reported frequency differs from
the actual frequency (because the real frequency is a floating point
value while the primitives return an integer) and is &lt;= the actual
frequency  (so most often what is reported is the same as what was
requested). (Yes, giving the nearest frequency would be better in both
cases).
- the output is high for approximately &quot;duty&quot; percent of the cycle
(again, rounding and imprecision), and the high part is at the end of
the cycle, not the beginning.
- you can call pio.whatever() on the same pins to turn the PWM outputs
into generic GPIOs like the others, even after having called calling
pwm.*() functions or while they are running. You can than call
pwm.setup to turn that GPIO pin back into a PWM output.
- if you change the frequency or duty cycle, it currently just
modifies them in the registers, so you probably get one cycle of junk
when you do this.
- platform-specific: there is a (currently disabled) mechanism to
delay freq or duty updates until the end of a cycle, but this makes
the &quot;set&quot; primitive delay up to one cycle if the frequency is changed.
Worse, with this mechanism, if you change both the frequency and the
length of the duty cycle in clocks, it can only update one of them at
a time, so there is both a potential two-cycle delay and a compulsory
intermediate cycle of junk, either at the old frequency and new duty
period or vice versa, depending on the change.

... and probably a lot more that is only documented as comments in the code.

Another example I noticed in passing: if you ask for an SPI clock rate
that is not supported, the code selects the arithmetically closest
available clock rate, which may be higher, so if you try to initialise
a device at its maximum rated transfer speed, the code can select a
higher one that is out of spec.

I think that without this level of detail in the documentation (which
becomes a specification) it is unlikely that an example program such
as tvbgone.lua will work on any platform other than the one it was
developed on due to the different timing characteristics and
behaviour.  This level of detail also helps us to ensure that the
different implementations behave the same way.
