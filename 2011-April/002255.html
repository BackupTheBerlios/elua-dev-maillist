</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I agree. We ignored this for too long. Doing eLua development with the CPU
datasheet opened at all times is possible, but certainly not pleasant. And
we can do better. And we have other similar problems. Things that we don't
signal explicitly:

1. pin assignments (for example activating an UART might steal a pin that is
currently assigned to a PWM output. it would be very nice to let the user
know about this)
2. timer delays that are too long/too short for the hardware timer to handle
3. PWMs frequencies that are too high/too low
4. invalid PIO operations (for example platforms that can't do pullup and/or
pulldown)

...and so on. One could say that this is a false problem; for example
tmr.delay can return an error if the delay is too short (or too long, I
can't remember; in any case for some reason I forgot to implement both cases
:<i>) ) and pwm.setclock returns the actual clock that was set on the PWM
</I>peripheral. True, but not enough. The program still needs to check these
errors explicitly. I find that at least in the prototyping phase I'd rather
have the system give me some warning/error messages automatically and let me
focus on the actual functionality instead of checking for error conditions
after each mod.function() call. Something like (following the examples
above):

1. Warning: PWM0 needs pin P0_3 which is aleady assigned to UART0.
2. Warning: delay 100000 is too long for TMR0
3. Warning: frequency 5000000 is too high for PWM0. Or Warning: can't set
frequency 50000000 on PWM0, the best aproximation is 48000000
4. Warning: P0_5 doesn't have an internal pullup.

Some of these (for example 2-4 above) can be implemented relatively easy
with minimum changes. Others (1) need special support and code that wasn't
written it. I really believe it's worth doing it though.


&gt;<i> However, I think there's also some question as to _how_ and _when_ one
</I>&gt;<i> would and should warn the user about such things.  Clearly one wants
</I>&gt;<i> to warn the user about potentially unexpected or undesirable behavior,
</I>&gt;<i> but where does one draw the line for this sort of thing. This is a
</I>&gt;<i> problem with most of the platform modules, and is particularly the
</I>&gt;<i> case with ADC where setting the &quot;clock&quot; for one channel, generally
</I>&gt;<i> means setting it for all the channels since they're all multiplexed,
</I>&gt;<i> but do I warn the user of that every time?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, until he explictly tells you not to. In my mind this has two phases:

1. prototyping phase. You experiment a lot in this phase and most likely you
want all the warnings you can get.
2. deployment and regular execution phase. In this case you're most likely
out of warnings anyway; if not, you still don't want them popping out
unexpectedly, so you'd either shut them off completely or redirect them to
somewhere else (for example in a file).

We can add some function to the elua module for this. Out of the top of my
head:

- elua.enable_warnings( true|false )
- elua.set_warning_device( this can be a file (stdout is of course
possible), an UART, a TCP/IP socket ... )

If you want to get fancy:

- elua.set_warn_level( level ) : we can define a set of warnings (like
verbose, debug, error...)
- elua.enable_warnings (true|false, [module1, module2, ..., modulen]) - the
more advanced version of the above which specifies warnings per module
instead of globally.

This requires a bit of work but it's definitely doable.

Perhaps there could be some pattern for functions like this that have
&gt;<i> side effects to not only return frequency that was set on the stack,
</I>&gt;<i> but also a list of the peripheral ids that were affected or something
</I>&gt;<i> similar?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Hmmm, interesting. I was initially thinking about letting each backend
return its own error message, however your approach is more generic which
makes it easier to implement (and more logical). The danger here, of course,
is that the error messages might become a bit too generic to give enough
information on the actual case of the error. For example:

Warning: PWM0 affects TMR0 and TMR1

What exactly does this mean? A frequency change? A pin that was &quot;stolen&quot;
from another peripheral? This might be clear from the context, or it might
not. In the end it might be better for each backend in turn to return its
own warning message (although this might lead to duplicated functionality in
different backends).


&gt;<i> We could also go in the direction of having a general facility, which
</I>&gt;<i> might actually be necessary in order to implement the warning system
</I>&gt;<i> in the first place, whereby the user would be able to check in advance
</I>&gt;<i> what groups would be affected by certain settings or changes on a
</I>&gt;<i> given platform.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, we need a general facility in any case.


&gt;<i> When we come upon details like this, I think we hit some difficult
</I>&gt;<i> questions (much more so than just implementing a new peripheral module
</I>&gt;<i> or general feature) of how to keep something like this simple and
</I>&gt;<i> usable without ballooning into something the size of the USB or ACPI
</I>&gt;<i> spec :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I, and I suspect Bogdan as well, really like the idea of describing
</I>&gt;<i> the platform, pin configurations and whatnot in a machine digestible
</I>&gt;<i> form both for the build system and for online documentation as well as
</I>&gt;<i> situations like this where the system would be able to provide useful
</I>&gt;<i> warnings if the user desired.
</I>

Yes, Bogdan likes this a lot too :)


&gt;<i> I'm also unsure how to prevent
</I>&gt;<i> something like this from becoming too resource intensive on an MCU
</I>&gt;<i> (aside from maybe optionally storing such information with
</I>&gt;<i> documentation on an SD card where the user could enable a flag to turn
</I>&gt;<i> on checking that would have an overhead cost).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You don't really have much choice here I'm afraid. The best we can do is a
remote database (which is exactly your SD card suggestion) with a structure
that makes it easily indexable on its storage so that one doesn't need to
read all of it into memory. Personally I'd be happy to have it even only in
Flash though :)


&gt;<i> Another thought could be this:  if the overhead is too high on the MCU
</I>&gt;<i> and we do have the MCU described in some sort of data structure, we
</I>&gt;<i> could provide some sort of eLua-lint that could be run on the desktop
</I>&gt;<i> that would spit out some platform-relevant warnings for the user?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I'm not sure that a compile-time solution is good enough (plus it would be
damn hard to implement). I think that a configurable runtime component (like
just about everything we have in eLua until now) is the way to go here.

Best,
Bogdan
