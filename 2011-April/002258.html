Not really. A large part of the eLua audience are those people that are NOT
embedded engineers but want to use the hardware anyway (see
<A HREF="http://www.eluaproject.net/en_overview.html">http://www.eluaproject.net/en_overview.html</A> for details). If I were one of
them I'd really appreciate a feature like this. Hell, I'd appreciate
something like this anyway because while I am quite familiar with embedded
systems in general I am also extremely lazy :) so I'd like to have my tools
outline my possible mistakes for me. Lazy or not this is likely to translate
into better efficiency in the end.


&gt;<i> who do need to be familiar with the characteristics
</I>&gt;<i> of device they are using, and need to know how to use eLua to achieve
</I>&gt;<i> the exact effects they require. in short, they need good
</I>&gt;<i> documentation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We can help them (and ourselves!) in this by documenting what the
</I>&gt;<i> modules/platforms actually do with much more precision and detail
</I>&gt;<i> (think of the precision of a datasheet: waveform characteristics,
</I>&gt;<i> timing behaviour, mandatory initialization/use sequences of the
</I>&gt;<i> primitives, bugs/defects in some scenarios) and we can make this task
</I>&gt;<i> easier and more comprehensible by making the different ports behave in
</I>&gt;<i> more similar ways.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let me give an example: I couldn't find out what the behaviour of a
</I>&gt;<i> PWM should be and don't have the other hardware platforms to be able
</I>&gt;<i> to compare them so have just had to guess while implementing it for
</I>&gt;<i> AVR32 and the result is the following:
</I>&gt;<i> - each channel's pin is not driven until pwm.start() is called for it,
</I>&gt;<i> at which point it becomes a driven output
</I>&gt;<i> - after pwm.setup(), the output remains low (GND) until pwm.start() is
</I>&gt;<i> called
</I>&gt;<i> - it always outputs a complete number of cycles even if you call
</I>&gt;<i> pwm.stop() immediately
</I>&gt;<i> - you can call pwm.start() before pwm.setup() if you like and it still
</I>&gt;<i> works
</I>&gt;<i> - the actual frequency differs from the required frequency and is
</I>&gt;<i> always &gt;= the requested frequency. The reported frequency differs from
</I>&gt;<i> the actual frequency (because the real frequency is a floating point
</I>&gt;<i> value while the primitives return an integer) and is &lt;= the actual
</I>&gt;<i> frequency  (so most often what is reported is the same as what was
</I>&gt;<i> requested). (Yes, giving the nearest frequency would be better in both
</I>&gt;<i> cases).
</I>&gt;<i> - the output is high for approximately &quot;duty&quot; percent of the cycle
</I>&gt;<i> (again, rounding and imprecision), and the high part is at the end of
</I>&gt;<i> the cycle, not the beginning.
</I>&gt;<i> - you can call pio.whatever() on the same pins to turn the PWM outputs
</I>&gt;<i> into generic GPIOs like the others, even after having called calling
</I>&gt;<i> pwm.*() functions or while they are running. You can than call
</I>&gt;<i> pwm.setup to turn that GPIO pin back into a PWM output.
</I>&gt;<i> - if you change the frequency or duty cycle, it currently just
</I>&gt;<i> modifies them in the registers, so you probably get one cycle of junk
</I>&gt;<i> when you do this.
</I>&gt;<i> - platform-specific: there is a (currently disabled) mechanism to
</I>&gt;<i> delay freq or duty updates until the end of a cycle, but this makes
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;set&quot; primitive delay up to one cycle if the frequency is changed.
</I>&gt;<i> Worse, with this mechanism, if you change both the frequency and the
</I>&gt;<i> length of the duty cycle in clocks, it can only update one of them at
</I>&gt;<i> a time, so there is both a potential two-cycle delay and a compulsory
</I>&gt;<i> intermediate cycle of junk, either at the old frequency and new duty
</I>&gt;<i> period or vice versa, depending on the change.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ... and probably a lot more that is only documented as comments in the
</I>&gt;<i> code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Impressive. Wow, I didn't know about most of the stuff you are talking about
here :) While some of them are implementation errors (for example the PWM
frequency being always higher than what you request) others are platform or
implementation quirks that are best documented in text (which is a job for
the wiki). I never intended to use the warnings system for very detailed
things like this but rather for easy to make mistakes (like the ones
outlined in my previous e-mail).


&gt;<i> Another example I noticed in passing: if you ask for an SPI clock rate
</I>&gt;<i> that is not supported, the code selects the arithmetically closest
</I>&gt;<i> available clock rate, which may be higher, so if you try to initialise
</I>&gt;<i> a device at its maximum rated transfer speed, the code can select a
</I>&gt;<i> higher one that is out of spec.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
IMO this is exactly the kind of situation where a warning could make things
much better. You set your clock in the program, eLua says &quot;hey, i can't give
you that, i'm going to setup something a bit higher&quot; and you think &quot;oh wait,
that's not good&quot; and try another clock. I simply can't think of a more
convenient way to do it. Don't forget that one of the strongest point of
eLua is that it makes (or is supposed to make :) ) prototyping very easy. I
believe these kind of warnings are a very good tool for making this goal a
reality.


&gt;<i> I think that without this level of detail in the documentation (which
</I>&gt;<i> becomes a specification) it is unlikely that an example program such
</I>&gt;<i> as tvbgone.lua will work on any platform other than the one it was
</I>&gt;<i> developed on due to the different timing characteristics and
</I>&gt;<i> behaviour.  This level of detail also helps us to ensure that the
</I>&gt;<i> different implementations behave the same way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Certainly. The more docs we have for a specific platform, the better.

Best,
Bogdan
