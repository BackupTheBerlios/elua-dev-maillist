Definitely. l maintain that this is also useful in the prototyping phase of
a project even if you know very well what you're doing. We're all prone to
mistakes.


&gt;<i> I aim for a production-quality system that permits you to drive the
</I>&gt;<i> hardware with precision to achieve quality results.
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, these two objectives are not mutually exclusive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, the objectives *do* conflict when it comes to something like
</I>&gt;<i> the difference between being able to set the duty cycle roughly in
</I>&gt;<i> percent or getting the maximum available precision, in which case you
</I>&gt;<i> need to be able to find out the period in cycles and set it to a
</I>&gt;<i> number of cycles.  If you just want to dim LEDs and don't mind the
</I>&gt;<i> dimming being visibly stepped at low values, percent is OK. If you
</I>&gt;<i> want to use PWM as a crude DAC, percent reduces it to being slightly
</I>&gt;<i> worse than a 7-bit DAC whereas the hardware (in this case) is capable
</I>&gt;<i> of 1 in 1000 precision at 11kHz - a little better than telephone
</I>&gt;<i> quality.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Why would the objectives conflict? You're talking about an API change which
has nothing to do with the proposed warnings system.
As a side note, as James already suggested a number of times, the PWM API
should really be changed. I'm talking about a major change (directly in the
platform interface). We can discuss how to accomplish this in another
thread. Martin, you seem to know a lot of things about how a PWM should
actually be used. Would you mind starting this thread?


&gt;<i> Yes, I know there's an issue proposing a higher precision of PWM duty
</I>&gt;<i> cycle specification, though I expect it will be to set it as a
</I>&gt;<i> fraction of a million, like the delays.  The most precise primitive
</I>&gt;<i> would be to be able to find out the period in clock cycles and to set
</I>&gt;<i> the duty period in clock cycles, but from what you say that seems
</I>&gt;<i> inappropriate to the eLua way of thinking.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I didn't mean to imply that, I apologize if I did. What I aim for is
platform independence, as much as possible. If you have an API that respects
that but allows for a better usage of a peripheral (PWM or anything else)
then I really don't have anything against implementing it.


&gt;<i> Or you (as the implementer) can know that SPI clocks tend to be chosen
</I>&gt;<i> to drive devices at their maximum rated speed, and select an available
</I>&gt;<i> speed that is as high as possible without exceeding the specified
</I>&gt;<i> speed, while UART baud rates need to be as close to the requested rate
</I>&gt;<i> as possible so that the communication is more likely to work,
</I>

Agreed.  This was always the intended functionality anyway (except for the
SPI part where AFARK none of the implementations try to return a clock which
is always lower than or equal with the expected one).

and PWM
&gt;<i> frequencies are more likely to be used to generate an audio tone or ti
</I>&gt;<i> signal devices that respond to PWM signals, so are probably best
</I>&gt;<i> chosen as close to the requested value as possible.
</I>

This, on the other hand, is something that I generally don't agree with:
enforcing a policy. I always believed this is a bad thing to do in general.
In this case the policy enforcement happens because of some assumptions like
&quot;PWM frequencies are more likely to be used to generate an audio tone&quot;.
Maybe or maybe not. You might feed this PWM into a boost converter and you
might not want to round to the nearest higher value in this case. Then you'd
like to return the lower value. Then again, your boost converter might be
working in inverted logic for some reason, thus in this case you'd want to
round to the nearest higher value. No good response here, the safest thing
to do is to round to the nearest value in either direction and let the user
know about this.


&gt;<i> However, it's well documented that the primitives return the actual
</I>
speed selected (or, rather a number close to the actual value!), so
&gt;<i> power programmers can check that to see what really happened and
</I>&gt;<i> correct if necessary.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, or they could completely forget about that :) I did this so many times
before that I can't even count them. So I'd be grateful if the sytem lets
them know about their mistake. I'm ready to bet that I'm not the only one.


&gt;<i> My feeling is that issuing a warning is a solution to the programmer
</I>&gt;<i> anxiety that arises when you can't do exactly what was asked and can't
</I>&gt;<i> decide what would be right. Dumping the problem on the user is one
</I>&gt;<i> solution, to make them decide. Another is to make a policy decision
</I>&gt;<i> (for example, if a requested value is higher or lower than the
</I>&gt;<i> possible values, set the highest or lowest possible, and if it cannot
</I>&gt;<i> be precisely obtained, set the arithmetically closest value, or the
</I>&gt;<i> nearest available lower value or whatever).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
As specified above I'm not a big fan on imposing policies in general. I
recently read &quot;Linux Device Drivers&quot; which seems to agree on the &quot;don't
inforce policy&quot; idea for drivers. Sometimes it makes sense (like the UART
situation you presented above). Sometimes it might only look that it makes
sense.


&gt;<i> Issuing a warning when the value is not precise creates the question
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;How much imprecision is not precise?&quot; More than an integer different?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You can always say &quot;Warning: clock set to y instead of requested x&quot;. That's
pretty precise :) and it lets the user decide on the actual implications of
this.


&gt;<i> That will throw errors all the time. More than 10% different?  Or 5%?
</I>&gt;<i> Why 5? Why 10? Do we need another primitive to set the imprecision
</I>&gt;<i> that triggers warnings?
</I>
OK, I'm exaggerating to make a point, but there is a risk that it just
&gt;<i> replaces a technical problem with a philosophical one and unless
</I>&gt;<i> someone wants to go through all the existing code looking for places
</I>&gt;<i> where a warning might be useful to a beginner, I can predict that the
</I>&gt;<i> warning support will be not be consistent, but just limited to a few
</I>&gt;<i> cases where the programmer thought it might be useful.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I can almost guarantee that it will be exactly this at first. However, if we
make it into an easy to use framework, implementers will hopefully feel
encouraged to add more warnings as they are found.

Best,
Bogdan
