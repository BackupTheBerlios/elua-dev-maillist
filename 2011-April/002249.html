</I>&gt;<i> Clock
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and for supporting the EK-LM3Sxxxx RIT OLED displays.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for the thought. In fact, the AVR32 PWM has some extra stuff
</I>&gt;<i> that people might need:
</I>&gt;<i> - alignment: left-aligned waveform or centred (symmetrical) waveform
</I>&gt;<i> - polarity: each cycle starts low then goes high, or starts hight then goes
</I>&gt;<i> low
</I>&gt;<i> - generating an interrupt at the end of each cycle of a waveform
</I>&gt;<i> which I guess are not portable between platforms.
</I>&gt;<i> However, for now I'm just trying to get something that works at all.
</I>&gt;<i> These platform-specific refinements can happen in a second moment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Conversely, if some but not all of the platforms support some feature,
</I>&gt;<i> say centre-aligned waveforms, then do we end up with
</I>&gt;<i> at91.pwm.alignment() avr32.pwm.alignment() and
</I>&gt;<i> other_board.pwm.alignment()?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Basically yes.
With the new, more powerful and more and more specific peripheral beasts of
today's MCUs, it becomes hard to support everything in a standard way. But
we must try to extract the most from the possibly-portable features, even if
they are not exactly the same and eventually loosing some functionality, and
add support for platform-specific ones in modules like the ones you've
mentioned.


In the specific case we are talking about here, the API change to
&gt;<i> start/stop (/configure?) several PWM outputs in one call seems
</I>&gt;<i> orthogonal to the other modules, as well as being a more convenient
</I>&gt;<i> syntax, and if a platform can't do it in reality, it can just start
</I>&gt;<i> several channels in a for loop in C, which will stil be more closely
</I>&gt;<i> aligned than doing it with a for loop in Lua.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Right.


&gt;<i>  &gt; As Bogdan has mentioned, we don't mind (too much :) changing the API to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; support better models, even if this breaks some code and this is why we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; haven't called any of our versions a eLua 1.0 yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sometimes the API needs redesigning (or refining) in the light of
</I>&gt;<i> practical experience, but given the small amount of code already
</I>&gt;<i> written for eLua, we should be able to do this without too much pain.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yep.
Finished and working applications can continue to run on older versions too,
just like it happens with lots of Lua apps.


&gt;<i> It's kinder to users if we ensure that existing code that uses the old
</I>&gt;<i> interface either continues working with some legacy interface, or
</I>&gt;<i> fails to compile with an error.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes. We can offer legacy-interfaces modules (be it Lua-C binds or plain Lua
massage code) if really needed. Usually, the growing clock speeds with time
tend to absorb the extra performance penalties for these solutions.


 &gt; But this should be done very carefully, not only to support one very used
&gt;<i> &gt; platform but to make sure the changes will bring benefits to all. If not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; possible, there will always be the handy solution of creating
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; platform-specific modules.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, although the API already contains stuff that cannot be
</I>&gt;<i> implemented on all platforms.
</I>&gt;<i> For example, the PWM interface thinks you can set the clock frequency
</I>&gt;<i> independently for each channel, both at the Lua level and the C
</I>&gt;<i> interface:
</I>&gt;<i> but none of the platforms can do this.  Changing the clock of one
</I>&gt;<i> channel changes it for all of the others (or &quot;some of the others&quot; in
</I>&gt;<i> the AT91 case!) - something users need to be aware of while writing
</I>&gt;<i> for a specific platform.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Humm, right and this doesn't sound too good for me.
I'm not sure if there is a clear or really widely portable solution for this
though.
It would be nice to hear more thoughts on this.

Already, platform-independent code is difficult in eLua.  Look at
&gt;<i> led.lua for example.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Well, I think this is actually a nice example of platform-independend code.
Of course, because of the pins assignments that may differ even within
different models of the same family sometimes, there will always be a need
for a code section to &quot;bind&quot; the program's I/O with the actual pins/ports
used. This is easily and nicely done in simple structures in Lua, be it with
the ugly big IF contruction of this example (done to make it simple for
starters) or with nice Lua tables.
Still, the rest of the code runs untouched among all supported platforms.
For small applications like the tiny led.lua example, the size of this
&quot;bind&quot; section can look big compared to the rest of the code. But for
serious applications it disappears on a Lua table definition or even a small
function to do the job.
