Yes, like a tourist in a foreign country where they don't speak the
language and can only point at things you can see, say &quot;This, this and
this&quot; and hold yuor money out for them to take (GUIs, I'm looking at
you! :)

&gt;<i> On another note: &#160;Silent failure is generally a bad idea in

</I>
As usual, there is the opposite proverb as well: &quot;Never check for
error conditions that you don't know how to handle&quot; :)

&gt;<i> Except, what we're talking about here is a user issuing a command
</I>&gt;<i> like... change the clock for PWM on one channel, and that affects
</I>&gt;<i> multiple channels, or the fractional period isn't the percent they
</I>&gt;<i> requested, or the clock isn't what they requested.
</I>
Right. So every time anyone sets a clock speed, it will always tell
them that it has also changed the clock speed of the other channels.
And every time they set an output frequency &gt;1000Hz it will print a
warning that the output frequency is imprecise.  That means spewing
always!

&gt;<i> Actually, as I think about this, I think that warnings like this
</I>&gt;<i> should probably be off by default
</I>
Here we agree. I guess that mean different compiles of the firmware:
firmware with debug/warning/educational messages and without.
I don't see a way to turn it on/off au runtime from the same firmware
if you want the device to start on power on
How about a new Lua module with warning.enable() and
warning.disable()?  Or better, put it inside the module &quot;elua&quot;.
elua.warnings = true (or non-nil?) to enable them.

While developing code you can easily add a line to do this at the
start of the first file.
Of course, I still need it under a compile-time flag for my precious 120KB.

&gt;<i> Heisenberg turn in his grave :-)
</I>Yes,  &quot;Theory&quot; means &quot;something that is not relevant to practice&quot; ;-)

&gt;<i> some extra
</I>&gt;<i> methods, if needed, can be just like learning more of a language to
</I>&gt;<i> become more expressive.
</I>
That's a good analogy.

&gt;<i> Addition of features carries quite a bit of weight not only because of
</I>&gt;<i> bloat, but because it can be difficult to take them back later :-)
</I>
I love those days when I can delete hundreds of lines of code.
It feels good.  I vote we kill pio.decode() today
