</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We can help them (and ourselves!) in this by documenting what the

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> primitives, bugs/defects in some scenarios) and we can make this task
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> easier and more comprehensible by making the different ports behave in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more similar ways.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Let me give an example: I couldn't find out what the behaviour of a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> PWM should be and don't have the other hardware platforms to be able
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to compare them so have just had to guess while implementing it for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> AVR32 and the result is the following:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - each channel's pin is not driven until pwm.start() is called for it,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at which point it becomes a driven output
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - after pwm.setup(), the output remains low (GND) until pwm.start() is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> called
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - it always outputs a complete number of cycles even if you call
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pwm.stop() immediately
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - you can call pwm.start() before pwm.setup() if you like and it still
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> works
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - the actual frequency differs from the required frequency and is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> always &gt;= the requested frequency. The reported frequency differs from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the actual frequency (because the real frequency is a floating point
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> value while the primitives return an integer) and is &lt;= the actual
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> frequency &#160;(so most often what is reported is the same as what was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> requested). (Yes, giving the nearest frequency would be better in both
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cases).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - the output is high for approximately &quot;duty&quot; percent of the cycle
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (again, rounding and imprecision), and the high part is at the end of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the cycle, not the beginning.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - you can call pio.whatever() on the same pins to turn the PWM outputs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> into generic GPIOs like the others, even after having called calling
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pwm.*() functions or while they are running. You can than call
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pwm.setup to turn that GPIO pin back into a PWM output.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - if you change the frequency or duty cycle, it currently just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> modifies them in the registers, so you probably get one cycle of junk
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when you do this.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - platform-specific: there is a (currently disabled) mechanism to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> delay freq or duty updates until the end of a cycle, but this makes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the &quot;set&quot; primitive delay up to one cycle if the frequency is changed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Worse, with this mechanism, if you change both the frequency and the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> length of the duty cycle in clocks, it can only update one of them at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a time, so there is both a potential two-cycle delay and a compulsory
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> intermediate cycle of junk, either at the old frequency and new duty
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> period or vice versa, depending on the change.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ... and probably a lot more that is only documented as comments in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Impressive. Wow, I didn't know about most of the stuff you are talking about
</I>&gt;<i> here :) While some of them are implementation errors (for example the PWM
</I>&gt;<i> frequency being always higher than what you request) others are platform or
</I>&gt;<i> implementation quirks that are best documented in text (which is a job for
</I>&gt;<i> the wiki). I never intended to use the warnings system for very detailed
</I>&gt;<i> things like this but rather for easy to make mistakes (like the ones
</I>&gt;<i> outlined in my previous e-mail).
</I>
I would agree that where there's an example of an error, we should
clearly fix that, and in no way am I suggesting that we don't lay down
a bit more in the way of detailing expected behavior and deviations
from it within documentation or on the wiki.

I can't speak for Bogdan, but I get the sense that we're thinking
somewhat similarly here in that if there were a system like this it
would be more for &quot;obvious&quot; side effects like settings applying to
groups of ids when the user only asked to apply it to 1. I think that
returning a different clock than requested is also a decent example.
I'm really more thinking of this as a &quot;we or the hardware are going to
make a non-obvious decision for you because we can't do exactly what
you asked for, we're going to let you know about that&quot; (that said,
documenting these quirks is also important).  Pin reassignments I
think are different.  I think we can almost upfront state that if you
use a pin on one peripheral mode then try to use it in another
peripheral mode it A) might not work without reconfiguration B) if it
does get reconfigured it's not going to work in the original
peripheral mode until you switch it back.

On a related note, since the duty cycles are fractional, I would
support some mechanism for letting the program or the user know about
what the actual selected fraction ended up being, just like we return
the actual frequency that was acquired even when we don't give the
user exactly what they requested.  I think we could maybe set some
minimum standards we use on implementations in order to make platforms
more consistent, but they're always going to differ to some extent
since they don't use the same clock dividers, register sizes,
configuration models, etc..

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Another example I noticed in passing: if you ask for an SPI clock rate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that is not supported, the code selects the arithmetically closest
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> available clock rate, which may be higher, so if you try to initialise
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a device at its maximum rated transfer speed, the code can select a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> higher one that is out of spec.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> IMO this is exactly the kind of situation where a warning could make things
</I>&gt;<i> much better. You set your clock in the program, eLua says &quot;hey, i can't give
</I>&gt;<i> you that, i'm going to setup something a bit higher&quot; and you think &quot;oh wait,
</I>&gt;<i> that's not good&quot; and try another clock. I simply can't think of a more
</I>&gt;<i> convenient way to do it. Don't forget that one of the strongest point of
</I>&gt;<i> eLua is that it makes (or is supposed to make :) ) prototyping very easy. I
</I>&gt;<i> believe these kind of warnings are a very good tool for making this goal a
</I>&gt;<i> reality.
</I>
Yep, although we do &quot;notify&quot; the user in the sense that we're supposed
to return the frequency that actually got selected so at least they
can look at their return parameter and decide if what they got was
acceptable.  I could see this sort of model extending further to
provide more details in return values on these types of decisions that
are made for the user (i.e.: let the user know what pwm fraction in
addition to clock was actually used when pwm.setup is called).  On the
other hand some sort of error/warning channel of logging output is
fairly simple and would be useful as well.

I could imagine this also working something like STDOUT and STDERR,
which might work nicely with our mux implementation to prevent these
types of messages from polluting the main interface stream.  In fact
this might be a generally useful facility for us when
testing/debugging to spit out messages on a separate stream.  We can
already do this in an adhoc manner, but I suppose this could establish
a standardized mechanism.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think that without this level of detail in the documentation (which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> becomes a specification) it is unlikely that an example program such
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as tvbgone.lua will work on any platform other than the one it was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> developed on due to the different timing characteristics and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> behaviour. &#160;This level of detail also helps us to ensure that the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> different implementations behave the same way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Certainly. The more docs we have for a specific platform, the better.
</I>&gt;<i> Best,
</I>&gt;<i> Bogdan
