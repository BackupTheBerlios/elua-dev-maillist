I make it my mission to prove this wrong :) Which of course I'll never be
able to do, as &quot;easy to use&quot; is a fairly subjective matter. But at least I
can try :) In this particular case, for example, a warning system which is
parallel to the actual peripheral API shouldn't make the system less
powerful. As long as you design your warnings system to follow your API and
not the other way around you shouldn't have to worry about performance.

I never used PWM in my life before, which is probably why I find it so
&gt;<i> difficult to understand how it should behave.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Ah, OK. My bad.


&gt;<i> &gt; The safest thing to do is to round to the nearest value in either
</I>&gt;<i> direction and let the user
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; know about this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK. That sounds like a good general guideline.
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, in the SPI case, the difference between the chosen
</I>&gt;<i> frequency and the actual frequency can be quite large. In a few tests
</I>&gt;<i> I ran, if you set the maximum SPI data rate for an SD card (400kHz)
</I>&gt;<i> the result was something like 35% higher because of the coarse
</I>&gt;<i> precision of the dividers when they are at small values. But to the
</I>&gt;<i> code, this seemed like the arithmetically closest value.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This is unavoidable unfortunately. Even with a very good API you're still
stuck with the platform-specific hardware limitations.


&gt;<i> On the second point, since the API returns the integer value closest
</I>&gt;<i> to the actual frequency selected, we have already achieved the &quot;let
</I>&gt;<i> the user know&#176; part in this case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As specified above I'm not a big fan on imposing policies in general.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you don't make a policy, you get chaos with every individual case
</I>&gt;<i> behaving in a different, random way. That is the current case in eLua.
</I>&gt;<i> But maybe we mean different things by the word &quot;policy&quot;.  I'm meaning
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;a guideline on how to make decisions when you're not sure what to
</I>&gt;<i> do&quot;, which then gets interpreted according to each case when you have
</I>&gt;<i> to make a decision.  In this case, the policy decision seems to be
</I>&gt;<i> changing from &quot;do whatever you like&quot; to &quot;if you can't do exactly what
</I>&gt;<i> the user asked for, print a warning&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Ideally we would have a combination of the two: choose a reasonable
aproximation of the input (what &quot;reasonable&quot; means needs to be decided) and
also issue a warning if the aproximation and the input have different
values. Once again, the warnings themselves shouldn't have any influence on
the actual functionality. In OOP terms, they should be simple observers. An
observer never modifies the state or functionality of the system it
observes, it just reads its internal state and executes some actions based
on this.
Agreed on the &quot;random way&quot; issue. For example, the return value of
platform_spi_setup  has this description:

*Returns*: the actual clock set for the SPI interface. Depending on the
hardware, this may have a different value than the *clock* argument.

A simple change like this:

*Returns*: the actual clock set for the SPI interface. Depending on the
hardware, this may have a different value than the *clock* argument. In this
case, the highest value which is lower than *clock* will be returned.

would be enough to make the policy clear. I always had this on my mind but I
found it so obvious that I forgot to specify it :) (except for the &quot;lower
than clock&quot; part which I completely missed until now). And you're right,
this isn't really policy. Or maybe it's that lowest level of policy that
ensures things aren't completely random. I don't know how to call it, but I
agree this minimal set of rules should be enforced.


&gt;<i> Linux device drivers are a very different world from a programming
</I>&gt;<i> system for beginners, so the policy there (of not enforcing one way of
</I>&gt;<i> driving a peripheral, but of having a complex programmer interface
</I>&gt;<i> that allows the caller to set the device up with as much precision and
</I>&gt;<i> flexibility as possible) is made according to the world of Linux
</I>&gt;<i> device drivers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Sure. It's a good generic principle though and I'm trying to follow it as
much as I can.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Issuing a warning when the value is not precise creates the question
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &quot;How much imprecision is not precise?&quot; More than an integer different?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You can always say &quot;Warning: clock set to y instead of requested x&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> That's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pretty precise :) and it lets the user decide on the actual implications
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Example: at 1MHz PWM clock rate, the same frequency as you asked for
</I>&gt;<i> is returned for every frequency &lt;= 1kHz.
</I>&gt;<i> Above 1kHz, most frequencies set (and return) something different,
</I>&gt;<i> with the granularity increasing as the frequency increases.
</I>&gt;<i> So if the system works by varying the frequency, most settings will
</I>&gt;<i> provoke a warning.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Which is perfectly fine. Once you're aware that something is wrong you can
turn off that warning (my original proposal included something like this)
and move on.  I can understand that a lot of warnings could quickly become
annoying but having a simple way to turn them on/off should help with this.

Best,
Bogdan
