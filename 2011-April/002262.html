In general, a system that is &quot;easy to use&quot; cannot be powerful and vice versa.

I never used PWM in my life before, which is probably why I find it so
difficult to understand how it should behave.

Thanks! Another application of PWM that I was unaware of...

&gt;<i> The safest thing to do is to round to the nearest value in either direction and let the user

</I>
OK. That sounds like a good general guideline.
Unfortunately, in the SPI case, the difference between the chosen
frequency and the actual frequency can be quite large. In a few tests
I ran, if you set the maximum SPI data rate for an SD card (400kHz)
the result was something like 35% higher because of the coarse
precision of the dividers when they are at small values. But to the
code, this seemed like the arithmetically closest value.
On the second point, since the API returns the integer value closest
to the actual frequency selected, we have already achieved the &quot;let
the user know&#176; part in this case.

&gt;<i> As specified above I'm not a big fan on imposing policies in general.
</I>
If you don't make a policy, you get chaos with every individual case
behaving in a different, random way. That is the current case in eLua.
But maybe we mean different things by the word &quot;policy&quot;.  I'm meaning
&quot;a guideline on how to make decisions when you're not sure what to
do&quot;, which then gets interpreted according to each case when you have
to make a decision.  In this case, the policy decision seems to be
changing from &quot;do whatever you like&quot; to &quot;if you can't do exactly what
the user asked for, print a warning&quot;.
Linux device drivers are a very different world from a programming
system for beginners, so the policy there (of not enforcing one way of
driving a peripheral, but of having a complex programmer interface
that allows the caller to set the device up with as much precision and
flexibility as possible) is made according to the world of Linux
device drivers.

&gt;&gt;<i> Issuing a warning when the value is not precise creates the question
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;How much imprecision is not precise?&quot; More than an integer different?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can always say &quot;Warning: clock set to y instead of requested x&quot;. That's
</I>&gt;<i> pretty precise :) and it lets the user decide on the actual implications of
</I>&gt;<i> this.
</I>
Example: at 1MHz PWM clock rate, the same frequency as you asked for
is returned for every frequency &lt;= 1kHz.
Above 1kHz, most frequencies set (and return) something different,
with the granularity increasing as the frequency increases.
So if the system works by varying the frequency, most settings will
provoke a warning.
