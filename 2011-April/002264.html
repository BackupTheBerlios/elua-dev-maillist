No, it's a decision you have to make when designing a system, and it
applies to all fields of technology.

If people want to be able to express themselves with precision, they
need a larger vocabulary, so need to understand more.
If you understand less, the range of concepts that you can express is smaller.

The thing to avoid is making a  system that is difficult to use and
still gives you no power. Think MS-DOS command.com

Computers are the most complex machines ever built, and creating the
illusion of simplicity is what programming is all about.
You do this by hiding the immense underlying complexity, which you do
by making decisions for the users and doing &quot;the right thing&quot; without
bothering them.
How successful you are in doing this determines how easy your product
is to use, and the goal is the same whether you are aiming at
high-level or low-level users.
The Linux device drivers are high-complexity because they give wide
expressive power to their callers, but they still hide everything else
that is not relevant.

A flood of warning messages exposes complexity instead of hiding it.
Think of a Windows machine where there is a constant flow of
distracting boxes popping up with incomprehensible messages in them.
No user likes that, whether naive or advanced. It confuses the naive
ones and annoys the advanced ones.

&gt;<i> the warnings themselves shouldn't have any influence on
</I>&gt;<i> the actual functionality.
</I>
Printing an error message IS a change in functionality.
If an application changes the duty cycle once per cycle (like the
crude DAC example), the flood of error messages to print on the serisl
port will slow the system to a crawl.
If they are controlling some device on the serial port, a warning
message will come out in the middle of their protocol.
At present, a running eLua program never writes anything to the UART
unless you ask it to.

&gt;<i> An observer never modifies the state or functionality of the system it
</I>&gt;<i> observes
</I>
An observer ALWAYS modifies the system it observes.
Unobtrusive observation, even though it is one of the dogmas of naive
scientists, is impossible. Even serious physicists have now woken up
to this.
It's one of the fallacies of scientific method (the other one is that
you can recreate the same initial state to repeat the same
experiment).

&gt;&gt;<i> Linux device drivers are a very different world from a programming
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system for beginners, so the policy there (of not enforcing one way of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> driving a peripheral, but of having a complex programmer interface
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that allows the caller to set the device up with as much precision and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> flexibility as possible) is made according to the world of Linux
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> device drivers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sure. It's a good generic principle though and I'm trying to follow it as
</I>&gt;<i> much as I can.
</I>
Don't do that if you want your system to be easy to use.
An expressive interface is complex, and a complex interface is more
difficult to use.
A simple interface is easy to use, but a simple interface doesn't let
you do much.
Choosing the right level of complexity/expressiveness in an interface
is an important choice, but it is still a choice. If you don't make
that choice consciously, the simple interface will grow lots of extra
methods to perform advanced tasks... which is what is happening to
eLua.

If you try to make it both complex and simple, both powerful and easy
to use, you are trying to resolve a paradox and are certain not to
succeed.
Of course, in the attempt to do the impossible, you may achieve enlightenment :)
