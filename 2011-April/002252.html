</I>
It's a thin line on the platform interface. If most of the platform support
the feature it will probably stick directly to the platform interface. If
not it will become a platform specific module even if these tend to repeat
themselves.


&gt;<i> In the specific case we are talking about here, the API change to
</I>&gt;<i> start/stop (/configure?) several PWM outputs in one call seems
</I>&gt;<i> orthogonal to the other modules, as well as being a more convenient
</I>&gt;<i> syntax, and if a platform can't do it in reality, it can just start
</I>&gt;<i> several channels in a for loop in C, which will stil be more closely
</I>&gt;<i> aligned than doing it with a for loop in Lua.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Some platforms might be able to do it in reality, but it will be always one
of these pesky &quot;platform specific&quot; functions.


&gt;<i> Sometimes the API needs redesigning (or refining) in the light of
</I>&gt;<i> practical experience, but given the small amount of code already
</I>&gt;<i> written for eLua, we should be able to do this without too much pain.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, that's exactly the plan :)


&gt;<i> It's kinder to users if we ensure that existing code that uses the old
</I>
interface either continues working with some legacy interface, or
&gt;<i> fails to compile with an error.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

&gt;<i> Of course, although the API already contains stuff that cannot be
</I>&gt;<i> implemented on all platforms.
</I>&gt;<i> For example, the PWM interface thinks you can set the clock frequency
</I>&gt;<i> independently for each channel, both at the Lua level and the C
</I>&gt;<i> interface:
</I>&gt;<i> but none of the platforms can do this.  Changing the clock of one
</I>&gt;<i> channel changes it for all of the others (or &quot;some of the others&quot; in
</I>&gt;<i> the AT91 case!) - something users need to be aware of while writing
</I>&gt;<i> for a specific platform.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, something has to be implemented for situations like this. Two main ways
I can think of:

1. document all of these platform-specific gotchas on the wiki
2. add warnings directly in eLua (configurable, like levels and on/off).

I'd go with 2 personally.


&gt;<i> Already, platform-independent code is difficult in eLua.  Look at
</I>&gt;<i> led.lua for example.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That's an example of bad implementation actually. What we would ideally do
is a more object-oriented approach, for example have a .lua file for each
board in turn (for example mbed.lua) that defines peripherals related to
that board. For example:

LED1 = pio.PA_6
LED2 = pio.PA_5
SW1 = pio.PB_0
.......

These files will be on the romfs of the eLua image. Then the led.lua would
just need to require( pd.board() ) and use LED1. It suddenly gets much
simpler :)

Best,
Bogdan
