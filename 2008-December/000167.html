<PRE>Hello Mike !   Nice to have you back ! Someone of this list arranged to lay
you off at work :) :) :)
   The current version of Pong depends only on a PutChar (on RIT display it
is called stringdraw() ) function to draw the ball and the paddle. If you
have pixel resolution to position it, instead of just lines x columns, your
ball will move smootly too.
    The driver/wrapper was implemented in a module called &quot;disp&quot;, which is
not good because it is platform-dependend. Also, the Lua code now requires
(yes, with require() ) a Lua module, called LM3S, that introduces the
Luminary Micro onboard goodies, like the buttons, leds and some utility
functions. This module is easially adaptable for your board devices (or
external components connected to it). I've been playing also with a version
that implements everything in C and it would be nice if we could load it
dinamically (we don't have dinamically loadable C modules, yet), only if the
board is an LM3S platform.
   So, as you can see, I've been playing a lot with different ways to write
modules, none of them to definitive yet. We must bring some more discussion
to the list, to show the pros &amp; cons of each approach.
   Teo and Ives has been working on a GPS module, 100% Lua (for now), with
lots of good points to discuss here too. We will have to write add an INT
handler for it (UART Rx), even not beeing a generic INT module for eLua yet,
as well as circular queues for the input stream (just for fun, once GPS Rx
doesn' t really need it :)
   I also need a Counter module, to read an RGB+Pan light sensor and, again,
I'll probably write it in C, over the Luminary Micro low level lib for
Timers and GPIO. It will not be a generic Counter module for eLua yet but it
should do the work for a small project here.
   These many possibilities for eLua module architectures may confuse users
at first but they are actually very versatile and I hope to write about it
on the wiki asap.
   Pedro is working on a PID module, 100% Lua and it will work over ADC and
DAC modules, that eLua also needs.
   Some other games are comming too :) as they are great for my students to
learn Lua, eLua, real-time programming and, last but not least, to have fun
!! :)
   Me and Bogdan have received an AVR32 board too, the EVK1100 and Bogdan
will begin to port eLua to it soon, with some possible issues due to what
Atmel has done to Newlib. Downhere, I will see what I can do for the Legos
NXTs, as soon as the classes are over and I can put my hands again on a kit
:<i>) :)
</I>   So welcome back and send us your ideas ! :)

Best
Dado
