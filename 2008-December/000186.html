<PRE>Hello dev guys,
   I agree with Bogdan that this should not come to a &quot;dev&quot; list. But as we
don't have an eLua User's List, I need to come here for some more opinions
(besides mine, Rafael's, Bogdan's and Yuri's) about the current test look of
the site.
   Is it really true that everybody is liking it ? :-o :)
   The impressions I've got from everyone I've asked downhere, including ALL
the questioned people from the Art's and Design Department of PUC-Rio (which
has nothing to do with our web guys of the Led Lab team) were very
disapointing.
   The not-black-over-white neither-white-over-black scheme, the orange, the
upper styleless art and; most shocking among the technical and Luawise
people; the idea of using the Lua logo with a different color (which imho is
really a bad move).
    As we all seem to be here, I am not design oriented enough to make a
point here but I think we should definetely hear some more ideas before
considering this as definitive. It looks nice on Yuri's site though, beeing
different from what all the other Sputnik users have chosen :)
    It is really nice to have some real and quick help but all this change
was too fast !!!! (1 day !!! :)

   And talking about web design, is there anybody there with some LM3S8962
timer/counter experience to help us configure ours ? :-o :) :)

Best
Dado
