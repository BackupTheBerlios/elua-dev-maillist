<PRE>&gt;<i> Hello dev guys,
</I>&gt;<i>    I agree with Bogdan that this should not come to a &quot;dev&quot; list. But as we
</I>&gt;<i> don't have an eLua User's List, I need to come here for some more opinions
</I>&gt;<i> (besides mine, Rafael's, Bogdan's and Yuri's) about the current test look of
</I>&gt;<i> the site.
</I>

No problem, it's OK to talk about things like this on this list.


&gt;<i>    Is it really true that everybody is liking it ? :-o :)
</I>

I don't know about everybody, but I sure do :)


&gt;<i>    The impressions I've got from everyone I've asked downhere, including
</I>&gt;<i> ALL the questioned people from the Art's and Design Department of PUC-Rio
</I>&gt;<i> (which has nothing to do with our web guys of the Led Lab team) were very
</I>&gt;<i> disapointing.
</I>&gt;<i>    The not-black-over-white neither-white-over-black scheme, the orange,
</I>&gt;<i> the upper styleless art and; most shocking among the
</I>

You people are killing me. Who on the Earth said that white over black and
black over white are the only &quot;right&quot; color schemes?! Personally I think B/W
schemes are the most boring and less imaginative out there. And what exactly
do you have against orange? Orange is a soothing colour IMO, and I don't see
anything wrong with it. It blends very nicely with black. I don't understand
what you meant by &quot;upper styleless art&quot;.


&gt;<i> technical and Luawise people; the idea of using the Lua logo with a
</I>&gt;<i> different color (which imho is really a bad move).
</I>

While I personally don't see a problem here, you might be right about that.


&gt;<i> And talking about web design, is there anybody there with some LM3S8962
</I>&gt;<i> timer/counter experience to help us configure ours ? :-o :) :)
</I>

You're on your own here buddy :)

Best,
Bogdan
