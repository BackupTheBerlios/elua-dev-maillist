<PRE>&gt;<i> I confirm the IP is static but pls redirect to 139.82.143.2/elua , if
</I>&gt;<i> posible. It will work, at least for some months, if you don't.
</I>
No, don't _redirect_. However controls the eluaproject.net domain
should login to their registrar's web site and do the following:

(1) deactivate web forwarding,
(2) enter the default name servers for your registrar (if they already
have values like &quot;ns19.yourregistrar.com&quot; then just leave them there),
(3) create two &quot;A&quot; records, one pointing &quot;@&quot; to 139.82.143.2 and
another pointing &quot;www&quot; to &quot;@&quot;. The fields might have different names,
for different registrars. Perphas, you set &quot;name&quot; to &quot;@&quot; and &quot;value&quot;
to &quot;139.82.143.2&quot; or &quot;host&quot; to &quot;@&quot; and &quot;points to&quot; to &quot;139.82.143.2&quot;.
(If you also see at &quot;TTL&quot; field than leave it as is or set it to 24
hours.)

After you do this, it would take a day or two for the data to
propagate, so people will be getting different results. Once it
propagates, however, someone going to eluaproject.net will start
seeing Sputnik, but still with &quot;eluaproject.net&quot; in the URL. Getting
rid of elua.cgi in the URL is a separate step - let's do this one
thing at a time.

&gt;&gt;<i> I can't do this :) Or don't know how. I assume it has to be done on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> server itself, and I only have access to the web admin interface (I should
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> probably point out that I know very little about Sputnik).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll check this with my web team on tuesday (PUC will be closed on monday)
</I>
Those are two separate things, though, we can deal with them one at a
time. I can help you with local server set up when I am at PUC.

&gt;<i> It would be nice indeed if we find some better place to host our eLua wiki,
</I>&gt;<i> if we can do whatever we want with Sputnik on it and have (almost) complete
</I>&gt;<i> admin access too, for free.
</I>
&quot;can do whatever we want&quot; and &quot;free&quot; are hard to reconcile. Sputnik
runs trivially on cheap shared hosting such as dreamhost, though. I
can host eLua wiki on my dreamhost account if you want, but this of
course means that you will have limited access. (Fr&#233;d&#233;ric offered the
same, I think.)

Alternatively, I've been planning to offer hosted Sputnik accounts
with git access. That is, your sputnik data would be stored in a git
repository and you will able to use git for backup, troubleshooting
and other fun stuff (like synchronization between several servers).
Let me know if you want to be a guinea pig.
