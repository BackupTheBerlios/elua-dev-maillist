<PRE>I don't think the web site is great - but I think it's adequate for  
the intended audience and objective. We're not trying to sell anything  
to the world, we're trying to communicate about eLua, a free open  
source platform for micro-controllers. This leaves us with a pretty  
geeky audience - an audience that has failed to demonstrate in the  
past any sort of consideration for design matters in particular or  
even good taste in general :)

I'd say: anything is fine as long as it's readable and &quot;legal&quot; (f.e.  
use the right colors for the Lua logo). So orange/white/black works  
for me in that perspective - and we avoid endless debates on the  
effective soothing-ness of the orange color :)

That said, I think (versus current /test/):
* the article &quot;what is eLua&quot; (front page) needs a (real) Lua logo (in  
addition to the eLua logo, if any).
* Putting the search box and login links below the menu (next to/below  
the RSS logo) would save some vertical space and kinda group &quot;controls&quot;
* Making the eLua logo as wide as the menu (or bigger than now and  
centered on the menu column) would not hurt.

Voila some comments - but again, what is there is perfectly OK for the  
audience and needs.
