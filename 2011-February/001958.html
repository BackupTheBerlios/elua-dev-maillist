<PRE>Thanks for your comments and time, Mike.

 

You need to register and then ask one of the admins to add you to the
project before you can edit the WiKi. I had to ask - the system we are using
is not very helpful. You also have to be a bit sneaky to work out how to add
a page as the index pages are not editable even when you are authorised!

 

The locking scheme *should* be mostly automatic and deadlock free. I
included an explicit, Lua level lock only for 'unusual' situations where
there are application level data dependencies in Lua (such as a linked list
or ring buffer with pointers held to entries in a table). If one coroutine
takes the lock (it is one global lock) and does not release it, the
asynchronous yield will remain blocked. Probably, the lock should be forced
off each time context is switched and perhaps an exception raised if it is
on when a coroutine explicitly yields. There is also a separate, fully
automatic, lock to protect Lua's internal data structures and it should be
impossible for that to deadlock (if I have coded it right).

I would have added this to the Discussion Page if I knew how to.

 

This seems like a good idea.


When I first red the proposal, I didn't understand the problem.  The &quot;big
loop&quot; approach seemed fine until I realized this is really about interrupt
handling.  Of course, it could be used in a broader sense.  At first, I was
thinking why add a level of indirection on a microcontroller platform.  I
was stuck on the word multitasking.  I understand now.


I haven't followed all your implementation details as of yet.  Will the
locking scheme prevent deadlocks?  Is it possible to just use one &quot;big&quot; lock
that protects global state?

Subject: [eLua-dev] Multitasking Proposal

Hi Everybody,

 

I have just published a proposal paper here:

 

<A HREF="http://tracker.eluaproject.net/projects/elua/wiki/PreemptiveCoroutinesPropos">http://tracker.eluaproject.net/projects/elua/wiki/PreemptiveCoroutinesPropos</A>
al

 

outlining my ideas (standing on the shoulders of giants) on how preemptive
multitasking could be provided in eLua. Please read and comment and
particularly criticise any flaws or weaknesses I may have missed. I also
believe this provides an alternative approach which ought to be considered
before the INT module (on which my proposal builds) is set in stone within
eLua.

 

Best regards,

 

John Hind.
