<PRE>It's good to hear the structure is going to be revised.  I've following the project for awhile but haven't really tried to using eLua.  I've started this process now but I'm finding it difficult to find all the information that I need.  The information appears to be all there but discovery is a problem.   I think it would help to have a more linear way (one topic leads to the next) of explaining the topics (like a book).  I've always liked the FreeBSD Handbook.  The &quot;Programming in Lua&quot; is also amazing.  I don't understand how Brazilians can write so well in English.  They write better than me, and I only know one language.  They put me to shame.

Hello,
On Mon, Feb 7, 2011 at 17:38, King, Mike &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/elua-dev">MKing at klmicrowave.com</A>&lt;mailto:<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/elua-dev">MKing at klmicrowave.com</A>&gt;&gt; wrote:
I've noticed that the wiki has similar content as the official docs.  Is this intended?

No it is not.
I see the value in having official documentation and have community content.  Microsoft has a similar practice, but they merge the two on the same page (ex: <A HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa363858%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa363858%28v=vs.85%29.aspx</A>).  This way it's easy to know if they is commentary and where to find it.  Does the eLua community think this is a good idea?  Or, is this a non-issue?

  I would like to be ready to announce a new site(s) and doc structure but, unfortunately, we need a couple of weeks more (up to 4 on the worse scenario).
  We started migrating some content from the &quot;main site&quot; to the wiki but we ended up launching v0.8 with some (silly) redundancies. I'm sorry for that and I hope a new site/doc structure will fix all of this soon.
  Both the &quot;main&quot; site and the wiki will be more &quot;integrated&quot; and it should be easy to navigate from them to some other services too (ie: web builder, issue tracker).
  A new format and web design should help to make the site(s) more appealing for the large and varied audience we have, maybe one of our biggest difficulties. But the important thing, of course, is the content we have there and this is one of the reasons we started moving tutorials, projects, platform-specific infos and other user-oriented content to the wiki format, hoping that we would have more help from the community to maintain it too.
  The Reference Manual (pls send me a better name for this ! :) :) will still be part of the main site and yes, I agree it can be enhanced with some more parameters infos and code examples. Again, it is nice to hear comments and suggestions here on the list, thanks.

Best
Dado
