Yes, that would be the second target with external dependencies.

</I>&gt;<i> down significantly).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Aside from the two comments above, how well has the AVR32 port with its

</I>
I believe Martin has responded to that already :) I do have something
to add though: this is mostly my fault. This model should work well as
long as the specific version of the external
libraries/headers/whatever used to built eLua are clearly specified
inside eLua. Even if they change the API might stay the same. What
happened to AVR32 was an unfortunate incident and we learnt a few
things from it. Mainly this one: specify the version of the external
tools eLua uses to compile itself inside eLua.

&gt;<i> then is it legally possible to include the PIC32 libraries and headers in
</I>&gt;<i> eLua's source?
</I>
I seriously doubt.

&gt;<i> I've attached the file MPLAB_C32_Compiler_License.rtf, which is distributed
</I>&gt;<i> with the Microchip PIC32 toolchain, to help answer these questions.&#160;&#160; It
</I>&gt;<i> covers the software (I'm not sure if that includes the source code) and
</I>&gt;<i> documentation.&#160; The files themselves include a wide variety of BSD, GPL,
</I>&gt;<i> modified BSD, Microchip, and MIPS licenses.&#160; Ugh.
</I>
Thank you, but I'm not even going to try to read it since I will not
be able to understand it. I tried to understand lawyerish before and
failed miserably. It's simply not my language. From what I could
gather though I don't think t we can include any part of the Microchip
toolchain in eLua. But once again, this shouldn't be necesary for the
reasons outlined above.
To recap: please continue working on porting eLua using the tools from
Microchip, but start from the asumption that we won't be able to
include any of these tools inside eLua. It's our job to take care of
the rest in a manner that is as painless as possible. The most elegant
solution that I have in mind is to add an explicit 'external_deps'
target to the new build system that will show the external
dependencies of the project. Something like this (off the top of my
head):

$ lua build_elua.lua board=pic32whatever external_deps
The PIC32 build of eLua depends on the following 3rd party tools:
- compiler version(s) : x, y, z
- Microchip packge version(s) : x, y, z
- libraries version(s) : x, y, z

Make this as verbose as possible so people will understand what's
going on. Checking the tool versions automatically is even a nicer
idea but it might not be worth the trouble.

Best,
Bogdan
