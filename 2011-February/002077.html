Bogdan, you brought up a point which I thought merited forking the
discussion.

You wrote that the AVR32 port is currently the only eLua target that has
external dependencies.  You may soon have two such projects; the PIC32 port
I'm working on will be most quickly accomplished if we use the Microchip
libraries and headers.

Unfortunately, these libraries and headers include a lot of different
license agreements; both MIPS copyrights and Microchip copyrights are
asserted.   If we work on the assumption that including them in the
repository is not legally possible, then it seems that we're restricted to
an external dependency (which seems to have caused problems for the AVR32
port already), or re-writing them from scratch (which would slow the process
down significantly).

Aside from the two comments above, how well has the AVR32 port with its
external dependencies worked?

If the answer to the above wuestion isn't &quot;Fantastic!&quot; (and I doubt it is),
then is it legally possible to include the PIC32 libraries and headers in
eLua's source?

I've attached the file MPLAB_C32_Compiler_License.rtf, which is distributed
with the Microchip PIC32 toolchain, to help answer these questions.   It
covers the software (I'm not sure if that includes the source code) and
documentation.  The files themselves include a wide variety of BSD, GPL,
modified BSD, Microchip, and MIPS licenses.  Ugh.

Thanks,
