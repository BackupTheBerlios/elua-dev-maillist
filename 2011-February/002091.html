<PRE>&gt;<i> I think one reason Microchip makes you pay for their optimizer is if you
</I>&gt;<i> don't, then you may have to buy a chip with larger memory.  So, pay for
</I>&gt;<i> the optimizer, or (maybe) pay more for the chip with larger memory.
</I>
&gt;<i> I'm not here to defend Microchip though.  I've mentioned to their FAE's
</I>&gt;<i> that they really need to stop charging for the tools.  I've beaten them up
</I>&gt;<i> about it on more than one occasion at their developer's seminars.
</I>
According to Dave Jones on The Amp Hour podcast, Dave has spoken with the CEO of Microchip and he said that there's internal forces within the company to have the tools division always make a profit.  Also, if it didn't show a profit then it may get cut.

To me, this seems shortsighted.

&gt;<i> If efforts of folks on this list lead to a FOSS tool set for the PIC32,
</I>&gt;<i> that would be awesome.
</I>
That would be nice but unlikely.
