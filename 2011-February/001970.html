<PRE>Wow, this is getting a lot of respones which is nice. A few random
thoughts on the subject:

1. while the current interrupt model in eLua might change a bit more
in the future I expect that the cetral idea will remain the same. The
reason is quite simple: most of the expected audience of eLua (people
with little or no programming experience at all) might not like to
hear about multitasking (be it preemptive or not). An interrupt-based
system is easier to understand than a non-preemptive multitasking
system and much easier to understand than a preemprive multitasking
system. Also, I'm trying to keep the original Lua usage model which
offers both easy to understand concepts and more advanced (sometimes
almost philosophycal :) ) ones which suits lots of users. So John,
don't worry that the current interrupt system might prevent your work
from entering eLua. In the end they'll most likely work in parallel.
2. most of the time I',m a big fan of what Fabien mentione ealier:
cooperative systems are powerful enough to fulfill the needs of most
applications out there. Preemptive multitasking is a very powerful
tool, but with great power comes great responsability, as always :) In
practice this translates into increased development and maintenance
effort on preemptive systems (I used them quite a bit and I know how
tricky they can be ever for seemingly innocent tasks). And I always
try to use the simplest tool for the job I have to do.
3. I managed to take a quick look at John's proposal and at the
interpreter bailout patch. Thanks for the idea, it's very good and I
loved the concept of forcefully inserting &quot;yield&quot; calls into the Lua
VM instruction stream to achieve preemptive multitasking. I'll have
more to say on the subject, but until then an observation: this still
isn't &quot;real&quot; preemptive multitasking. All you have to do is call a
blocking C function from the Lua VM and the multitasking is gone. And
there are quite a few such blocking functions in eLua (tmr.delay or
uart.read with an infinite timeout are the usual examples). They don't
even have to be blocking actually, if they take a long time to execute
(take the same uart.read function but this time with a timeout of one
second or more) the net effect is that preemptive multitasking isn't
really preemptive anymore. This limits the applicability of the idea
as the user must be specifically instructed to avoid these calls. In
the light of this I don't know how much actual advantage you'd gain
from this kind of pseudo-preemptive multitasking (and I mean that BTW,
I really don't know :) I'd like to hear people's oppinions on this). I
thought long and hard about true multitasking capabilities in eLua and
my conclusion is that this can't be achieved without a C level threads
library and all the complexity that comes with this.

Best,
Bogdan
