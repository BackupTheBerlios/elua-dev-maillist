<PRE>Who's developing the port for PIC32?  I may start it if someone else hasn't started it within a few months.  I've heard the PIC32 toolchain can be built from source without Microchip's code optimization limitations.  Does anyone know of any pre-built binaries or instructions on building from source?

And I'm interested as well!  I have a couple parts (PIC32MX795F512L) in shipment, and am developing a board for them when I'm not at work or typing this email.  I hope it wasn't my statement a few weeks back that I'd be working on developing these that got this on the site, as it's likely to be at least mid-March before I get &quot;Hello, World&quot; loaded on the board, and developing drivers for a few peripherals will take precedence over getting eLua to work on it, so it's likely to be a couple months before I start working on porting it to my board.

What is everyone else using for development?  From Microchip, there's a Starter Kit, USB Starter Kit, and an Ethernet (and USB) Starter Kit.   The Explorer 16 has a compatible board, and there's also a Multimedia Expansion board for the Starter Kits.  I'll be working on my own board, but I'll be trying to make my modules as board-independent as possible, and hope to benefit from (and provide benefit to) anyone using another tool.

Just joined eLua list, is this thing on?



We hear you loud and clean Ivan :) Welcome to the list!



Best,

Bogdan

Thank you.

Since I'm new to the eLua list, let me state my main reason for being here is my interest in using eLua on the PIC32.  I do a lot of work with Microchip stuff, and while their older architectures don't have what it takes compared to the ARM chips, the PIC32 is a new deal, based on the MIPS 4K embedded core.  I'm not here to debate or advocate architectures, though.  My reason for using PIC32 was that about 2 years ago I started a design which would have been based on a Luminary Cortex-M3 part.  However, the no-stock and insane lead times that occurred forced me to cancel that design and use something else.  That something else was a PIC32.  I see on the eLua site that PIC32 is mentioned as a port in progress, but no details.  Can someone bring me up to speed on what has been done with the PIC32 port, and what remains to be done?  I'm willing to render assistance with tools procurement, but I've never ported eLua, so I have no idea what work is required to do that.

Best regards,
Ivan Baggett
