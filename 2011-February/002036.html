<PRE>On a related note, I guess now would be a good time to make eLua
libc-independent :) Or in other words to make it contain its own libc
and whatever else is needed. It was a goal since the early days but
nobody found time to implement it until now.

Best,
Bogdan

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. Is it acceptable to use the compiler tools available with MPLAB?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We don't seem to have much choice at the moment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The versions without time limits that support optimization beyond level 0
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are several thousands of dollars.&#160; I have access to these versions through
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> my employer, but I'm not sure about the legality of web builders or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> providing binaries on the website.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think you can safely provide binaries (a lot of open source projects
</I>&gt;<i> provide binaries built with commercial versions of Visual C, I don't
</I>&gt;<i> see why it would be different for Microchip). However I wouldn't like
</I>&gt;<i> to have code in the eLua repository that can only be compiled with a
</I>&gt;<i> commercial tool.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't think we should use the High Tech C Compiler, as it's not only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> expensive but also proprietary and would likely not play nice with the GCC
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> code in eLua.&#160; Plus, I don't have it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> :) That's always a good reason ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3. Is it acceptable to us the Microchip libraries?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Once again, from what I could gather we don't have a real choice here.
</I>&gt;<i> We obviosuly can't include them in the project so we have to provide a
</I>&gt;<i> wa to include them in the link step as external libraries.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is the biggest sticking point.&#160; Bringing in these libraries causes a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 64kB code size limitation unless you pay several thousand dollars.&#160; We can't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> host these files in the source repository due to licensing.&#160; Newlib (which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> eLua uses) is an option (there's no reason that these libraries need to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> installed), and there have been several efforts with varying success to port
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Newlib to the PIC32.&#160; I believe that the MSPGCC project has a version which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is very close to what we want.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How exactly would the MSP port help here? These are very different
</I>&gt;<i> architectures. Or are you interested only in the C side side of things
</I>&gt;<i> (like libc or libm) and not on the actual chip support libraries?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The whole GCC/GPL debacle surrounding the PIC32 compiler is an interesting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one.&#160; Not only are there Microchip licensing problems, but you also have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> MIPS licensing to deal with, the optimizations, the GPL'ed compiler, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> non-GPL optimizer, the alternative compiler, etc. etc. etc.&#160;&#160; It's an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interesting read.&#160; Start at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.embeddedrelated.com/usenet/embedded/show/91196-1.php;">http://www.embeddedrelated.com/usenet/embedded/show/91196-1.php;</A> there are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> other pages and discussions. Note the dates when you're reading; a lot has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> changed since these parts came out.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In my mind, a Newlib-based cross-platform environment which can be imported
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> into MPLAB but requires no Microchip-hosted sources and license agreenments
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is best.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you have a Newlib-based environment I don't see a need for MPLAB in
</I>&gt;<i> the equation. Sure, it would be a good &quot;nice-to-have&quot; feature, but not
</I>&gt;<i> a must.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best,
</I>&gt;<i> Bogdan
