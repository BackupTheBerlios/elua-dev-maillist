<PRE>&gt;<i> Why do people use silicon from such a sleazy company then?  It seems that
</I>&gt;<i> Microchip is willfully violating the GPL if they have somehow time limited
</I>&gt;<i> the optimization in GCC...  There are much more 'GPL friendly' cores in
</I>&gt;<i> existence such as the Cortex-M3 from ARM that can be sourced from just
</I>&gt;<i> about
</I>&gt;<i> anywhere and have no such limitations in the compilers.
</I>
As I mentioned before, I started the project wanting to use an Atmel
AT91SAM7XC chip.  No stock.  Then I looked at a Luminary Cortex-M3 chip. 
I checked availability, also no stock.  26 week lead time.  Then I looked
at PIC32, and they were in stock.  We have a winner!  It's that simple. 
That was about 2 years ago.  Things have improved since then, but I was
forced down the PIC32 path, so I'm in it to win it.

&gt;<i> I would personally be hesitant to work with a company that so flagrantly
</I>&gt;<i> violates the GPL...
</I>
I doubt Microchip violates the GPL, they can afford legions of lawyers to
tell them where the loopholes are.

I think one reason Microchip makes you pay for their optimizer is if you
don't, then you may have to buy a chip with larger memory.  So, pay for
the optimizer, or (maybe) pay more for the chip with larger memory.

I'm not here to defend Microchip though.  I've mentioned to their FAE's
that they really need to stop charging for the tools.  I've beaten them up
about it on more than one occasion at their developer's seminars.

If efforts of folks on this list lead to a FOSS tool set for the PIC32,
that would be awesome.
