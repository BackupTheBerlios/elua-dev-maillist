I think that this is really three questions:

1. Is it acceptable to use the MPLAB IDE?
It's windows only, but otherwise a very nice IDE.  I prefer command line
development to most IDEs, and I would really like this to be cross
platform.  I wouldn't object if an MPLAB project file showed up in source
control, though.
2. Is it acceptable to use the compiler tools available with MPLAB?
The versions without time limits that support optimization beyond level 0
are several thousands of dollars.  I have access to these versions through
my employer, but I'm not sure about the legality of web builders or
providing binaries on the website.
I don't think we should use the High Tech C Compiler, as it's not only
expensive but also proprietary and would likely not play nice with the GCC
code in eLua.  Plus, I don't have it.
3. Is it acceptable to us the Microchip libraries?
This is the biggest sticking point.  Bringing in these libraries causes a
64kB code size limitation unless you pay several thousand dollars.  We can't
host these files in the source repository due to licensing.  Newlib (which
eLua uses) is an option (there's no reason that these libraries need to be
installed), and there have been several efforts with varying success to port
Newlib to the PIC32.  I believe that the MSPGCC project has a version which
is very close to what we want.

The whole GCC/GPL debacle surrounding the PIC32 compiler is an interesting
one.  Not only are there Microchip licensing problems, but you also have
MIPS licensing to deal with, the optimizations, the GPL'ed compiler, the
non-GPL optimizer, the alternative compiler, etc. etc. etc.   It's an
interesting read.  Start at
<A HREF="http://www.embeddedrelated.com/usenet/embedded/show/91196-1.php;">http://www.embeddedrelated.com/usenet/embedded/show/91196-1.php;</A> there are
other pages and discussions. Note the dates when you're reading; a lot has
changed since these parts came out.

In my mind, a Newlib-based cross-platform environment which can be imported
into MPLAB but requires no Microchip-hosted sources and license agreenments
is best.
