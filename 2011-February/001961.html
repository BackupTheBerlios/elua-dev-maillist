<PRE>I kind of have sympathy with this. I agree that any asynchronous yield
should be an optional feature. Roberto's hellgate of non-determinism has
already kind of been opened in eLua with the INT module and, it could be
argued, by the debug hooks in baseline Lua. Personally I have never had a
problem with shared memory multitasking, but it is true you can easily get
in a subtle mess if you do not follow the rules. I have not entirely
convinced myself that we are 'following the rules' with this kind of VM code
splicing either in my asynchronous yield or (much more so) the system used
in the INT module.

 

Your system, which is essentially Patrick Rapin's system as I referenced,
and therefore my suggestion without the asynchronous yield, is the important
part. However you cut it, we need non-blocking, interrupt based I/O and
particularly a non-blocking time delay. Your ability to hook a Lua function
to an interrupt generated event so it gets queued for execution
synchronously during the next non-blocking wait is also a good additional
feature since it avoids the RAM overhead of a coroutine in some simpler
cases.

Hi,

 

we (Sierra Wireless) have quite some experience running a customized Lua VM
on embedded devices, although our hardware is slightly more powerful than
the typical eLua target (several hundreds KB of RAM). We enjoy the
development speed, the flexibility, and ease of porting between different
OSes.

 

Among others, we use Lua-level multitasking extensively, to get concurrency
without any assumption about OS-level threading. We take the collaborative
approach; in practice, we almost never have any issue with threads not
yielding fast enough: all our I/O operations yield, and embedded code spends
most of its time doing I/Os anyway.

 

Given the maintenance issues associated with task preemption (to paraphrase
Roberto, you shouldn't trust a language whose interpretation of `n=n+1'
isn't deterministic), and the lack of pathologically uncollaborative tasks
we've experienced in the real life, I wonder how common the need for
coroutine preemption might be. I know it's clearly not worth it at all for
us.

 

Unsurprisingly, our API is similar to yours:

- sched.run (func, args...) to start a thread

- sched.signal (emitter, event, args...) to notify a noteworthy event

- sched.wait (emitters, events) to block on signals

- sched.kill (task)

- sched.sighook (emitters, events, hookfunction) to react immediately to a
signal (no blocking calls allowed in the hook).

 

The generic Lua part of our code is MIT-licenced
(<A HREF="https://svn.anyware-tech.com/wavecom/openat-lua/branches/oatlua4">https://svn.anyware-tech.com/wavecom/openat-lua/branches/oatlua4</A>), although
some important lower level bricks aren't (TCP, SSL etc.).
