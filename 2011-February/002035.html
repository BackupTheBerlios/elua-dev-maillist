<PRE>&gt;<i> 1. Is it acceptable to use the MPLAB IDE?
</I>&gt;<i> It's windows only, but otherwise a very nice IDE.&#160; I prefer command line
</I>&gt;<i> development to most IDEs, and I would really like this to be cross
</I>&gt;<i> platform.&#160; I wouldn't object if an MPLAB project file showed up in source
</I>&gt;<i> control, though.
</I>
It's accetable to use whatever you want as far as I'm concerned.
However the current build system (scons-based) is quite dynamic; it
defines different macros based on its arguments and even does
different arrangements for different platforms. I'm not sure how easy
it would be to replicate this kind of functionality with an IDE unless
you forget the project-based approach and use it as an editor that
calls external tools to actually build the project. In any case I'd
really appreciate having also a way to build from the command line,
not only from the IDE.

&gt;<i> 2. Is it acceptable to use the compiler tools available with MPLAB?
</I>
We don't seem to have much choice at the moment.

&gt;<i> The versions without time limits that support optimization beyond level 0
</I>&gt;<i> are several thousands of dollars.&#160; I have access to these versions through
</I>&gt;<i> my employer, but I'm not sure about the legality of web builders or
</I>&gt;<i> providing binaries on the website.
</I>
I think you can safely provide binaries (a lot of open source projects
provide binaries built with commercial versions of Visual C, I don't
see why it would be different for Microchip). However I wouldn't like
to have code in the eLua repository that can only be compiled with a
commercial tool.

&gt;<i> I don't think we should use the High Tech C Compiler, as it's not only
</I>&gt;<i> expensive but also proprietary and would likely not play nice with the GCC
</I>&gt;<i> code in eLua.&#160; Plus, I don't have it.
</I>
:<i>) That's always a good reason ;)
</I>
&gt;<i> 3. Is it acceptable to us the Microchip libraries?
</I>
Once again, from what I could gather we don't have a real choice here.
We obviosuly can't include them in the project so we have to provide a
wa to include them in the link step as external libraries.

&gt;<i> This is the biggest sticking point.&#160; Bringing in these libraries causes a
</I>&gt;<i> 64kB code size limitation unless you pay several thousand dollars.&#160; We can't
</I>&gt;<i> host these files in the source repository due to licensing.&#160; Newlib (which
</I>&gt;<i> eLua uses) is an option (there's no reason that these libraries need to be
</I>&gt;<i> installed), and there have been several efforts with varying success to port
</I>&gt;<i> Newlib to the PIC32.&#160; I believe that the MSPGCC project has a version which
</I>&gt;<i> is very close to what we want.
</I>
How exactly would the MSP port help here? These are very different
architectures. Or are you interested only in the C side side of things
(like libc or libm) and not on the actual chip support libraries?

&gt;<i> The whole GCC/GPL debacle surrounding the PIC32 compiler is an interesting
</I>&gt;<i> one.&#160; Not only are there Microchip licensing problems, but you also have
</I>&gt;<i> MIPS licensing to deal with, the optimizations, the GPL'ed compiler, the
</I>&gt;<i> non-GPL optimizer, the alternative compiler, etc. etc. etc.&#160;&#160; It's an
</I>&gt;<i> interesting read.&#160; Start at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.embeddedrelated.com/usenet/embedded/show/91196-1.php;">http://www.embeddedrelated.com/usenet/embedded/show/91196-1.php;</A> there are
</I>&gt;<i> other pages and discussions. Note the dates when you're reading; a lot has
</I>&gt;<i> changed since these parts came out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In my mind, a Newlib-based cross-platform environment which can be imported
</I>&gt;<i> into MPLAB but requires no Microchip-hosted sources and license agreenments
</I>&gt;<i> is best.
</I>
If you have a Newlib-based environment I don't see a need for MPLAB in
the equation. Sure, it would be a good &quot;nice-to-have&quot; feature, but not
a must.

Best,
Bogdan
