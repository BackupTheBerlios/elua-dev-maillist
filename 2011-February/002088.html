&gt;<i> I don't think it's clear from those comments whether they're violating
</I>&gt;<i> the GPL or not.  It sounds like they're distributing some &quot;secret
</I>&gt;<i> sauce&quot; with their own version of the compiler, and depending on the
</I>&gt;<i> way that's done that could either be a violation or not.  For example,
</I>&gt;<i> CodeSourcery, the ARM maintainer for GCC has their own commercial
</I>&gt;<i> products with special headers, libraries, startup code (CS3), and
</I>&gt;<i> debug sprite that they distribute with special licenses.  They're
</I>&gt;<i> also, however, a much more welcome part of the community, since they
</I>&gt;<i> contribute a lot of patches to gcc, newlib, etc...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>The biggest difference between what CodeSourcery is doing and what Microchip
(seems to be?) doing is that CS is not limiting the maximum size of the
executable or the optimization levels, both of which would be part of the
compiler/linker which are GNU code.  The way CS makes the commercial version
of the compiler more attractive is like you said, they add a debug sprite,
and there is a level of integration with the IDE that you don't have in the
free version.  No modifications are done to the base compiler, everything is
outside of the compiler and is therefor clearly not a violation.


&gt;<i> Clearly, however, Microchip is being less friendly.  One thing I've
</I>&gt;<i> never really understood is why a company would restrict copying of
</I>&gt;<i> header files containing register locations that they publish in
</I>&gt;<i> datasheets or manuals that are freely available.  Sure, I suppose it
</I>&gt;<i> is intellectual property, but I thought generally the goal of a
</I>&gt;<i> hardware maker was to get people to develop on one's hardware by any
</I>&gt;<i> means possible.  Arbitrary restrictions would seem to impede that,
</I>&gt;<i> especially when one wouldn't be restricted if one were to just
</I>&gt;<i> translate the documentation into new header files.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I never understood that myself...  Atmel has actually gone one step beyond
</I>(in the good direction) by distributing XML files that can be used to
autogenerate headers for the chips (at least the AVR/AVR32 ones).  I wish
more vendors would do this...



&gt;<i> I'm certainly not going to discourage ports to new platforms, as long
</I>&gt;<i> as the quality of the port is generally good and all licenses involved
</I>&gt;<i> are complied with in the process.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Most of eLua is MIT licensed now, like Lua itself.  There are various
</I>&gt;<i> exceptions to this for some libraries and other chunks of code we've
</I>&gt;<i> included along the way, but there shouldn't be any GPL code currently
</I>&gt;<i> in eLua.  A lot of the non-MIT licensed code is BSD license or
</I>&gt;<i> similar: <A HREF="http://www.eluaproject.net/en_overview.html#license">http://www.eluaproject.net/en_overview.html#license</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ahh, thanks for that update.  I could have looked myself, but clearly I was
</I>too lazy. ;)
