<PRE>Hello,

And the instructions on how to use them with eLua are at
<A HREF="http://www.eluaproject.net/en_installing_stm32.html">http://www.eluaproject.net/en_installing_stm32.html</A>



&gt;<i> Project #1 a PID controller for an oven to solder SMT boards, this will

</I>

Very nice


&gt;<i> It will interface to a 20 key pad
</I>

There's a nice $3.95 model from Sparkfun at
<A HREF="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/8653">http://www.sparkfun.com/products/8653</A>  (of course there's always cheaper
options elsewhere).

, a graphic display,


We have a couple of drivers working already and would love to have more,
including touch screen support, quickly appearing on some units now.

a A/D port reading a K thermocouple amplifier, sound alarms, and an
&gt;<i> optically isolated Solid state relay to control the heater elements. I will
</I>&gt;<i> graphically show the temperature live and be able to store calibrating data
</I>&gt;<i> as to what the behavior of the heater is like so it will not overshoot is
</I>&gt;<i> temperature. I don't have too many doubts that this will work since the
</I>&gt;<i> control loop does not need to be very fast dues to the slow nature of the
</I>&gt;<i> process.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Sounds like a very well fitted project for eLua



&gt;<i> Project #2 is the control element of a homemade radio transceiver. This
</I>&gt;<i> will use a PC keyboard
</I>

for which Thiago Naves wrote a nice C driver for eLua already. It is
documented on our wiki at <A HREF="http://wiki.eluaproject.net/eLuaPCKBD">http://wiki.eluaproject.net/eLuaPCKBD</A>


&gt;<i> , mouse, Graphic display, and USB port and RS232 Port to communicate with a
</I>&gt;<i> PC or  a DSP processor. The controller will provide control of filters,
</I>&gt;<i> timing control as the radios switches between receive and transmit
</I>&gt;<i> functions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Project #2 is more questionable since I have not actually tried eLua so I
</I>&gt;<i> don't know how fast it is,
</I>

Lua code in eLua, for obvious reasons, will never be as fast as C code. But
we want to make it easy (easier than what it is today) for users like
yourself, to code in C where you need more performance and easily integrate
this into your application, be it as a loadable C binary module (a roadmap
feature) or as a driver statically linked to the eLua image built for your
platform (already available but still a bit hard to use. We're currently
working on making it easier).

also for this to work I need access to i2c hardware and possible USB ports
&gt;<i> which support are not yet available for the ARM controller that I will use.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You can try to go with UARTS and FTDI for USB, if you don't need a true USB
host/slave architecture.
You can mention the modules you need that are not yet supported on our Wish
List (<A HREF="http://wiki.eluaproject.net/Wish%20List">http://wiki.eluaproject.net/Wish%20List</A>). I2C libs are available for
most platforms and it is just a matter of extending the support for it.

Since these are new projects and I don't have Lua experience compatibility
&gt;<i> is not an issue for me, although it would be nice to not deviate from the PC
</I>&gt;<i> versions of Lua.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
We strive to be full Lua and we actually think that this is one of the main
characteristics of eLua. Most of the embedding high-level languages
initiatives end up with a sub-sub-sub-set of the language and we don't want
this from the start. There are will always be some modules where differences
will be found (ie: the &quot;os&quot; module, once we don't have an OS below but
still, we'll have it linked to our file-systems in the future) but the main
functionality is completely implemented, including some embedded-oriented
extensions (like romable tables and functions, emergency garbage collection,
...).

I'm looking forward to this experiment and I'm hoping it all works out as an
&gt;<i> interactive system is a great help in working out the problems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for providing the software.
</I>

Thank you very much for using and for supporting eLua.

list at <A HREF="ttp://wiki.eluaproject.net/Who%20is%20using">ttp://wiki.eluaproject.net/Who%20is%20using</A>
