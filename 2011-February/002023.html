<PRE>I'm also interested in the PIC32 port.

Just joined eLua list, is this thing on?



We hear you loud and clean Ivan :) Welcome to the list!



Best,

Bogdan

Thank you.

Since I'm new to the eLua list, let me state my main reason for being here is my interest in using eLua on the PIC32.  I do a lot of work with Microchip stuff, and while their older architectures don't have what it takes compared to the ARM chips, the PIC32 is a new deal, based on the MIPS 4K embedded core.  I'm not here to debate or advocate architectures, though.  My reason for using PIC32 was that about 2 years ago I started a design which would have been based on a Luminary Cortex-M3 part.  However, the no-stock and insane lead times that occurred forced me to cancel that design and use something else.  That something else was a PIC32.  I see on the eLua site that PIC32 is mentioned as a port in progress, but no details.  Can someone bring me up to speed on what has been done with the PIC32 port, and what remains to be done?  I'm willing to render assistance with tools procurement, but I've never ported eLua, so I have no idea what work is required to do that.

Best regards,
Ivan Baggett
