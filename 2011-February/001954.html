<PRE>I would have added this to the Discussion Page if I knew how to.

This seems like a good idea.

When I first red the proposal, I didn&#8217;t understand the problem.  The &#8220;big loop&#8221; approach seemed fine until I realized this is really about interrupt handling.  Of course, it could be used in a broader sense.  At first, I was thinking why add a level of indirection on a microcontroller platform.  I was stuck on the word multitasking.  I understand now.

I haven&#8217;t followed all your implementation details as of yet.  Will the locking scheme prevent deadlocks?  Is it possible to just use one &#8220;big&#8221; lock that protects global state?

Subject: [eLua-dev] Multitasking Proposal

Hi Everybody,

I have just published a proposal paper here:

<A HREF="http://tracker.eluaproject.net/projects/elua/wiki/PreemptiveCoroutinesProposal">http://tracker.eluaproject.net/projects/elua/wiki/PreemptiveCoroutinesProposal</A>

outlining my ideas (standing on the shoulders of giants) on how preemptive multitasking could be provided in eLua. Please read and comment and particularly criticise any flaws or weaknesses I may have missed. I also believe this provides an alternative approach which ought to be considered before the INT module (on which my proposal builds) is set in stone within eLua.

Best regards,

John Hind.
