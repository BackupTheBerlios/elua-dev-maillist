<PRE>I'm new to the list and new to Lua so I don't 
have any fantastic application but I'll tell you 
what I'm planning to try with eLua.

I have several compatible boards on their way for 
two separate projects, the ET-SMT32 from 
Futurlec, they are pretty reasonable at $25.
&lt; 
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.futurlec.com/ET-STM32_Stamp.shtml">http://www.futurlec.com/ET-STM32_Stamp.shtml</A>&gt;<A HREF="http://www.futurlec.com/ET-STM32_Stamp.shtml">http://www.futurlec.com/ET-STM32_Stamp.shtml</A> 
  &gt;

Project #1 a PID controller for an oven to solder 
SMT boards, this will control an ovens heater 
element to ramp up and down the temperature in an 
oven in a controlled way so that a PCB board is 
soldered properly while avoiding damaging the 
components. It will interface to a 20 key pad, a 
graphic display, a A/D port reading a K 
thermocouple amplifier, sound alarms, and an 
optically isolated Solid state relay to control 
the heater elements. I will graphically show the 
temperature live and be able to store calibrating 
data as to what the behavior of the heater is 
like so it will not overshoot is temperature. I 
don't have too many doubts that this will work 
since the control loop does not need to be very 
fast dues to the slow nature of the process.

Project #2 is the control element of a homemade 
radio transceiver. This will use a PC keyboard, 
mouse, Graphic display, and USB port and RS232 
Port to communicate with a PC or  a DSP 
processor. The controller will provide control of 
filters, timing control as the radios switches 
between receive and transmit functions.

Project #2 is more questionable since I have not 
actually tried eLua so I don't know how fast it 
is, also for this to work I need access to i2c 
hardware and possible USB ports which support are 
not yet available for the ARM controller that I will use.

Since these are new projects and I don't have Lua 
experience compatibility is not an issue for me, 
although it would be nice to not deviate from the PC versions of Lua.

I'm looking forward to this experiment and I'm 
hoping it all works out as an interactive system 
is a great help in working out the problems.

Thanks for providing the software.

Never take life seriously. Nobody gets out alive anyway.
