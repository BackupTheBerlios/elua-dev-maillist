<PRE>Two additional remarks, drawn from personal experience:

   - In practice, you need some locking mechanisms even in collaborative
   multithreading, although mmuch less frequently. At least some form of mutex.
   - The kind of work done under interruption and within demanding realtime
   constraints is usually simple and not portable. As a result, the advantage
   of Lua over C in such contexts isn't as huge as usually.

Also, there's a serious issue with the Java-like multithreading model, as
opposed to the Unix-like multi-process model. With threads (shared memory),
you'll eventually leak memory as your application grows more complex, and
the only way to fix this is by rebooting the whole VM.

In a well designed Unix application, there are lots of short-lived processes
with separate data (save some carefully delimited IPC). Many of those
processes won't even bother freeing allocated memory: everything is
reclaimed when the process is killed, at the end of its ideally short life.
This forgotten but robust way of managing memory is finally rediscovered,
e.g. in Google Chrome's architecture. Building an application this way is a
strong incentive to choose RTOS preemptive processes, *if* the underlying OS
is powerful enough and you're willing to use processes the proper way.
However, such OSes will more typically run the regular Lua VM than eLua.
