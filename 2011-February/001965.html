&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> we (Sierra Wireless) have quite some experience running a customized Lua VM
</I>&gt;<i> on embedded devices, although our hardware is slightly more powerful than
</I>&gt;<i> the typical eLua target (several hundreds KB of RAM). We enjoy the
</I>&gt;<i> development speed, the flexibility, and ease of porting between different
</I>&gt;<i> OSes.
</I>&gt;<i>

Hi Fabien. It is great to have you in this thread too, as we all know you've
been playing with a (proprietary) RTOS embedded in your GPRS Modems where
you embedded Lua and they are successful commercial products already. For
those who didn't know, Fabien designed the sw for previous Wavecom modems,
before they were bought by the giant Sierra Wireless.

Among others, we use Lua-level multitasking extensively, to get concurrency
&gt;<i> without any assumption about OS-level threading. We take the collaborative
</I>&gt;<i> approach; in practice, we almost never have any issue with threads not
</I>&gt;<i> yielding fast enough: all our I/O operations yield, and embedded code spends
</I>&gt;<i> most of its time doing I/Os anyway.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, I've mentioned this in an early message. While having preemptive
multitasking can be great for the growth of our project and for the maturity
of many products, cooperative cooroutines will always be easier to use, are
natively implemented (by Lua), are infinitely easier to debug and, if used
correctly, are enough for a lot of problems.

Given the maintenance issues associated with task preemption (to paraphrase
&gt;<i> Roberto, you shouldn't trust a language whose interpretation of `n=n+1'
</I>&gt;<i> isn't deterministic)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Which means Lua VM bytecode execution is atomic for this as we were
wondering :)


&gt;<i> , and the lack of pathologically uncollaborative tasks we've experienced in
</I>&gt;<i> the real life, I wonder how common the need for coroutine preemption might
</I>&gt;<i> be. I know it's clearly not worth it at all for us.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unsurprisingly, our API is similar to yours:
</I>&gt;<i> - sched.run (func, args...) to start a thread
</I>&gt;<i> - sched.signal (emitter, event, args...) to notify a noteworthy event
</I>&gt;<i> - sched.wait (emitters, events) to block on signals
</I>&gt;<i> - sched.kill (task)
</I>&gt;<i> - sched.sighook (emitters, events, hookfunction) to react immediately to a
</I>&gt;<i> signal (no blocking calls allowed in the hook).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Again, for those who don't know, Fabien came to Rio in 2009 and, together
with me and Bogdan (who came too !:) made a talk on his uses of Lua on
Wavecom products and their futures. Among other things, he announced (and it
was a pleasure to hear !) that future Wavecom/Sierra Wireless products with
Lua embedded would be &quot;eLua API compatible&quot; too.  As they are ahead of us on
this and strongly pushed by commercial demands, with a nice base of products
on the streets already, I think it is great to have him here and it is
interesting to check their API (resumed above) too.


The generic Lua part of our code is MIT-licenced (
&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://svn.anyware-tech.com/wavecom/openat-lua/branches/oatlua4">https://svn.anyware-tech.com/wavecom/openat-lua/branches/oatlua4</A>),
</I>&gt;<i> although some important lower level bricks aren't (TCP, SSL etc.).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Too bad :(
But I know and must mention here Fabien's personal and continuous efforts to
convince the big bosses up there to open those too.
Thank you again for this Fabien.

Best
Dado
