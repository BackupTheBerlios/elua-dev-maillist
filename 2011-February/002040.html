<PRE>Hi Everyone

The other day I had an eLua revelation. I am about two years away from 
being able to write quality production level C code and about one year 
away from quality Lua code as well.

There are so many non-native English speakers here that could 
linguistically kick my ass, that I don't think my writing skills are a 
great asset either.

As you have probably already realized I am still at a day-dreaming(AKA 
crack smoking) level when it comes to coding ideas. I dream something up 
but it never ends up finished.

However about 10 years ago I passed the crack smoking stage with 
scientific instrumentation ideas and after 5 years I now have a proven 
business. I can take ideas from start to finish and they generate revenue.

So to the point, I think that the only real asset I bring here is end 
use cases.

Money-talk is highly frowned upon, for good reason, on other lists but 
here we have a hardware element and with it real world costs and real 
world processes. Is it alright if I post eLua related, hardware oriented 
quote requests and people could respond off-list?

To give a partial example, let's say I need some device to do 
such-and-such and someone mentions that this can only be done with 
such-and-such microcontroller, I could pay for someone to port it and 
maybe create Gerber file for a small design too. I could have it 
fabricated in Canada and I/we could share the port and the use case with 
the project.


Thanks-Patrick
