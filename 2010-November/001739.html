</I>&gt;<i> My current list of hacks is:

</I>
Hmmm, only 46k? Is this coming from the absence of libm alone, or the
compiler's floating point support is also not linked in the image? It
shouldn't be, as I specifically tried not to use floats or doubles in
the eLua source code. But it might be worth checking anyway, errors
are always possible.

&gt;<i> - optram=0
</I>
This is going to hurt you on the RAM side, big time. Also many modules
from the eLua distribution don't work at all in this mode. How much
space are you saving with this setting anyway?

&gt;<i> - allocator=newlib (=simple is smaller but takes 5 seconds to start up)
</I>
This is a bug, it doesn't have any good reason to do that. I'll take a
look at it when I have some time. Might be something related to AVR32
being a big endian architecture, I never tested the simple allocator
on big endian targets.

&gt;<i> - enable CCFLAGS = ['-DLUAC_TRUST_BINARIES']
</I>
Thanks for this tip :)

&gt;<i> - reduce the huge number of strings in the Lua interpreter by
</I>&gt;<i> simplifying some of the more verbose error messages (example: &quot;too
</I>&gt;<i> many results to unpack&quot; and &quot;too many results to resume&quot; both become
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;too many results&quot;, which generates a single copy of the string)
</I>
Does the linker optimize this globally? I thought this happens only at
file object level.

&gt;<i> - replacing strerror with something that just prints the value of
</I>&gt;<i> errno, so that the 3KB table of Unix system call error messages is not
</I>&gt;<i> pulled in from the C library
</I>
Nice (and see my remarks at the end of this e-mail).

&gt;<i> - disable lua 5.0 and 4.9 compatability flags
</I>
Again, thanks for the tip.

&gt;<i> - disable things which seem only to be used when Lua is included in a
</I>&gt;<i> larger C program as an embedded scripting language:
</I>
Such as ? I'm curious.

&gt;<i> &#160;- parts of the debug interface (lua_{getupvalue,setupvalue,setlocal}
</I>
You might want to remove registration for the &quot;debug&quot; module
altogether, it might save even more space.

&gt;<i> &#160;- the hook interface
</I>
If you remove the hook interface you won't be able to use Lua
interrupt support on your platform. Which probably won't fit anyway :)
so you're probably OK.

&gt;<i> Also, is the dump/undump code likely to be used in Lua applications?
</I>&gt;<i> It seems to be used to write/read compiled Lua code to files or for
</I>&gt;<i> transmission over the net, and to load precompiled Lua applications.
</I>
This is exactly what it is used for. You need it for romfs='compile'
mode, for cross-compiling and maybe for LuaRPC (not sure about this
last one).

&gt;<i> Lastly, are the &quot;bit&quot;, &quot;pack&quot; and &quot;term&quot; modules specific to eLua,
</I>&gt;<i> hence unikely to be used in existing Lua applications?
</I>
&quot;bit&quot; and &quot;pack&quot; are taken from lhf's page
(<A HREF="http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/~lhf/ftp/lua/">http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/~lhf/ftp/lua/</A>) and chances are there
are used in Lua applications, especially the &quot;bit&quot; module. &quot;term&quot; is
100% eLua specific.

&gt;<i> Other?
</I>
Did you remove all the BUILD_xxxx stuff that you don't need from
platform_conf.h? What about all the modules that you don't need?
In the end you can always restart what I tried to do a while ago and
rewrite the C library, at least partially :) You don't even have to
rewrite it. I was planning to include the Minix libc (you can find it
in the Minix source tree) in eLua, as it is very small (and BSD
licensed unlike other small libcs out there). It's perfectly doable, I
just don't have the time to do it right now. Actually you started this
yourself when rewriting strerror, so why not continue it? :)
It always helps to have a size report on this. Try something like
'find . -name &quot;*.o&quot; | xargs avr32-size' and we can analyze that.
Also, are you doing this for Mizar32? If so, is executing code from
RAM not an option for you?

Best,
Bogdan
