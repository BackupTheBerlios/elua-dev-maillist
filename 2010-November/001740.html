</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; I'm investigating how to reduce the size of the flash-rom image of

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My current list of hacks is:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - configs: build lualong (no FP, saving 46KB!)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hmmm, only 46k? Is this coming from the absence of libm alone, or the

</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't be, as I specifically tried not to use floats or doubles in
</I>&gt;<i> the eLua source code. But it might be worth checking anyway, errors
</I>&gt;<i> are always possible.
</I>
libm is absent, yes, and looking at the binary I don't see any
floating point emulation library functions, so you seem to have
succeeded.

&gt;&gt;<i> - optram=0
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is going to hurt you on the RAM side, big time.
</I>That's ok, we have 32MB of RAM but only 120K flash.

&gt;<i> Also many modules
</I>&gt;<i> from the eLua distribution don't work at all in this mode. How much
</I>&gt;<i> space are you saving with this setting anyway?
</I>
Thanks. Do you know which and why? The saving is 4096 bytes.

&gt;&gt;<i> - reduce the huge number of strings in the Lua interpreter by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simplifying some of the more verbose error messages (example: &quot;too
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> many results to unpack&quot; and &quot;too many results to resume&quot; both become
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;too many results&quot;, which generates a single copy of the string)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does the linker optimize this globally? I thought this happens only at
</I>&gt;<i> file object level.
</I>
It does.

&gt;&gt;<i> - disable things which seem only to be used when Lua is included in a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> larger C program as an embedded scripting language:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Such as ? I'm curious.
</I>
The following points were a list of them. I'm wondering if there are others.

&gt;&gt;<i> &#160;- parts of the debug interface (lua_{getupvalue,setupvalue,setlocal}
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You might want to remove registration for the &quot;debug&quot; module
</I>&gt;<i> altogether, it might save even more space.
</I>
That's how I'm doing it, leaving the linker to optimise the unused
functions and data out.

&gt;&gt;<i> Lastly, are the &quot;bit&quot;, &quot;pack&quot; and &quot;term&quot; modules specific to eLua,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hence unikely to be used in existing Lua applications?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;bit&quot; and &quot;pack&quot; are taken from lhf's page
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/~lhf/ftp/lua/">http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/~lhf/ftp/lua/</A>) and chances are there
</I>&gt;<i> are used in Lua applications, especially the &quot;bit&quot; module. &quot;term&quot; is
</I>&gt;<i> 100% eLua specific.
</I>
Good. They are relatively small. bit:1024 pack:2048 term: 2076

&gt;<i> Did you remove all the BUILD_xxxx stuff that you don't need from
</I>&gt;<i> platform_conf.h? What about all the modules that you don't need?
</I>Yes and yes.

&gt;<i> In the end you can always restart what I tried to do a while ago and
</I>&gt;<i> rewrite the C library, at least partially :) You don't even have to
</I>&gt;<i> rewrite it. I was planning to include the Minix libc (you can find it
</I>&gt;<i> in the Minix source tree) in eLua, as it is very small (and BSD
</I>&gt;<i> licensed unlike other small libcs out there). It's perfectly doable, I
</I>&gt;<i> just don't have the time to do it right now. Actually you started this
</I>&gt;<i> yourself when rewriting strerror, so why not continue it? :)
</I>&gt;<i> It always helps to have a size report on this. Try something like
</I>&gt;<i> 'find . -name &quot;*.o&quot; | xargs avr32-size' and we can analyze that.
</I>
The libraries -lgcc and -lc add 25600 of text (tested by linking
without -lc -lgcc and with -r).
That's an interesting idea.

It's difficult to analyse from the .o files because a lot of code is
compiled into the .o's and then eliminated by the linker.

&gt;<i> Also, are you doing this for Mizar32? If so, is executing code from
</I>&gt;<i> RAM not an option for you?
</I>
Yes and yes; we are also working on a small bootloader to load the
executable from SDcard instead of flash to allow full FP lua with all
modules.
