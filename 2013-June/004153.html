<PRE>Hi All,

I have a token-passing protocol stack (C code) that need to run in
background (over SAM7x uart1).
Idea is -- using uLua I can encapsulate the objects (functions) from this
protocol and interact with 
them via Lua script.
So far I have tried a couple of approaches:
1) Create platform independent module for the protocol to access its
services using three functions: 
    proto.heartbeat, proto.setval abd proto.getval. 
    proto.heartbeat, entry function into protocol's state-machine needs to
be called every 5~10 mS, 
    so that it can receive, process and pass tokens in timely fashion. To
maxmize speed, I am using 
    complied (.lc) bytecode of my script; which looks something like this:
       /proto.setval(1,&quot;RLY2&quot;) --turn on relay 2
       while uart.getchar(1,0)==&quot;&quot; do --continue until knock on term...
           proto.heartbeat()
           if(proto.getval(&quot;SWT1&quot;)==1) then proto.setval(1,&quot;RLY1&quot;) else
proto.setval(0,&quot;RLY1&quot;) end
	end/
    Problem/ challenge here -- not sure how fast eLua interpreter/ VM gets
invoked, but this doesn't 
    allow token passing to happen in timely manner. RLY2 does get set to 1
(and relay clicks on) but 
    but the one in the loop (RLY1) doesn't get serviced at all. Apparently
because heartbeat must be 
    getting called fast enough, causing token/s to be dropped.
2) If I call heartbeat() raw C/directly from main.c -- now proper
token-passing behavior is restored.
    But now, I need to have a way to alternately pass control to eLua VM/
processor. Therefore this 
    question -- if I had lua byte code (contents of .lc/ .luac file) loaded
in local memory, how can I 
    execute those chucks in-between calls to heartbeat?

Please feel free to suggest any alternate solution/s, such as speeding up
eLua invocation, perhaps 
that might allow me to use approach #1 above (by speeding up call frequency
to proto.heartbeat).

Any help, pointers will be greatly appreciated.

P.S. I had great fun exploring and playing with eLua so far...My Sincere
THANKS to all developers 
involved in bringing it to us. Excellent stuff!!!

Thanks,
Ash
