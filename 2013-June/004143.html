<PRE>I have been following eLua for a while with the aim of deploying it on a custom STM32F4xx project. I have successfully built the STM32F407_Discovery image with the now obsolete &quot;scons&quot; based builder, but have not yet been successful with the new &quot;lake&quot; builder. I am not too worried about that at the moment as I have not spent much time on it. But I do have some basic questions to get a feel for where eLua is going:

1. Lua 5.1 is specified for eLua. Using Lua 5.2 may be the cause of my present problems. Is Lua 5.2 supported and if not is it intended to do so soon? Moving to a total Lua build system makes sense, but staying at Lua 5.1 does not!

2. The STM32F4xx branch has been around for a while (although not on main git until very recently) and has not been merged with Master yet. Can anyone comment on its status?

3. My working platform is a Mac. Are there any known issues in building eLua on a Mac? So far I have not discovered any.

4. Present issue is with require&quot;lfs&quot; not accepting lfs.so. Paths are ok. Suspecting Lua versions. Comments anyone? 

Obviously much good work has gone into eLua by Bogdan and others for which I am grateful and hope to return some value in the coming months.

Graham
