<PRE>
* I wrote this mail in the morning. I thought I posted this but I just saw
it and apparently I didn't. My apologies.

Hello,

&gt;<i> One thing that was lost in transition to the new build system were
</I>&gt;<i> the switches telling the compiler and the assembler about the target
</I>&gt;<i> CPU.  (-mcpu=cortex-m3 -mthumb )
</I>
It is not a bug. We simply don't have the `cpu' option anymore. You
now build the code base by specifying the `board' option. In your case
that would look like this:

./build_elua.lua board=ek-lm3s8962 prog

&gt;<i>From another post:
</I>&quot;In other words, the old invocation 'scons cpu=&lt;...&gt;&quot; doesn't work at
all anymore. This makes sense, since eLua is generally built to run on
a board, not a CPU.&quot;

Please check the documentation [1] for more information on this.

&gt;<i> Not sure if this omission affects other cortex platforms as well.
</I>
The build process is common for all targets. You specify `board'.

&gt;<i> One downside of the new build system, it seems to assume that
</I>&gt;<i> all boards that use the same platform will also use the same CPU
</I>&gt;<i> architecture. [...] has the aforementioned assumption built into it.
</I>
That is not true. eLua currently doesn't support any Cortex-M4 clone
for LM3S and hence you don't see a reference to arch=`cortexm4'
in the platform_list table (from build_data.lua) you mentioned.

&gt;<i> How do I add the LM4F120, making it use the LM3s platform, but tell
</I>&gt;<i> the build system that it is a cortex m4 processor? Some tweaking of
</I>&gt;<i> build_data.lua should make it possible to handle this situation
</I>&gt;<i> gracefully.
</I>
Getting eLua to run on the LM4F120 involves a bit of work (assuming
you have the perquisites [2]). You will need to touch various files and
add a few.

1. You may start off with build_data.lua and add the your new cpu
under the lm3s entry and include reference to Cortex-M4 for the
architecture (but it isn't the real deal yet).

2. Touch lm3s/build_config.lua to include board specific details. This is
generally used to specify configuration which is not available on other
platforms/boards. For example: The OLED module is not available on
all LM3S targets. So, the macro `ENABLE_DISP' is only defined (-D on
gcc) for the boards that support it.

3. You must also include your device specific files (should be supplied
by TI) like device specific headers and other platform libraries in lm3s/
See lm3s/driverlib for an example; this will give you an idea.

3. Add your linker file (something like lm4f-120.ld) and hack lm3s/conf.lua
to include this by checking for your board. Include the path to your device
specific files and add other compiler specific options like -mcpu=cortex-m4
here.

4. Your must also add a new file for your board in boards/known. This
contains the build configuration for your board.

5. Hopefully, if everything goes well, you should be able to run eLua on
your LM4F Cortex-M4 board.

I would suggest that you look into the code [3] for the other LM3S cpus.
This might give you an idea on how to extend the same for your new
target.

Good luck! Have fun with your board.

Best,
Raman
