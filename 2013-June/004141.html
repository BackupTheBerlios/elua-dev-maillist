Really? You didn't even read the configurator docs before deciding to trash
the new build system? In any case, this is what the configurator does, yes (
<A HREF="http://www.eluaproject.net/doc/master/en_configurator.html">http://www.eluaproject.net/doc/master/en_configurator.html</A>). However, this
only works with the new, Lua based build system, because it is written in
Lua and interfaces with the builder's Lua code. The branch that I've
created for you uses the old scons-based build system and thus you still
have to edit your platform_conf.h manually.

One of the things that I've learnt from life is that it is ocasionally
helpful to get informed properly on a topic before getting all outraged
about said topic. I recommend this to you, it's a good exercise. For
example, should you have done that in this particular situation (especially
since I've already told you that there is now a functional &quot;uselake&quot; branch
on github that everybody can look at), you would've found that the
differences to build_elua.lua are actually quite small. In fact, after
getting myself accustomed with lake, it took me little over an hour to have
the first eLua target bulding with lake. There are two main reasons for
this:

- builld_elua.lua is mostly about executing the configurator, reading the
backend specific configuration files, setting the compiler/linker/assembler
flags, getting the list of files and other such tasks. The part that
actually invokes the build process is in the last section of the file; when
that section is reached, the things that are build-system independent (file
list/compilation flags) are already set.
- lake and my actual builder are not that different conceptually, thus
switching to lake was not that hard. When I say &quot;my builder&quot;, I reffer to
utils/build.lua, the build system that I wrote specifically for eLua. But
this is only the part that does the actual build (invoking the
compiler/linker/assembler, taking care of dependency analysis and so on);
the rest of the system (configurator and the main part of build_elua.lua)
are completely independent of the builder. As I already said in a number of
ocasions, writing my own build system for eLua (and again, by this I'm
reffering only to utils/build.lua) was a mistake; we simply didn't need
another build system, it was something that started as an exercise and went
too far eventually. This is why I am removing this part and ONLY this part
and replacing it with lake, which is a dedicated build tool that seems to
fit eLua perfectly.

To summarize, after lake will be in place, the only thing that MIGHT change
is that instead of:

# lua build_elua.lua &lt;options&gt; ...

you'll have to do:

# lake &lt;options&gt; ...

And not even that will change if Steve (lake's author) agrees to package
lake as a module that I'll be able to use from build_elua.lua, in which
case the build system invocation won't change at all. On the backend
configuration side, I expect very little things to change, so you won't
have anything to maintain there. Although there is another branch that I'm
working on to refactor the various toolchain options in a single place,
which does change the build system a bit more. The idea here is that eLua
is a dynamic project, it changes and it will keep on changing. I understand
your resistance to change, but this is not going to stop, so we have to
find a common ground somewhere.

Best,
Bogdan
