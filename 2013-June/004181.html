<PRE>
Finally got eLua to compile using the new builder system.
Targeting LM3s8962 and LM4F120

One thing that was lost in transition to the new build system were the switches telling the compiler and 
the assembler about the target CPU. &#160;(-mcpu=cortex-m3 -mthumb )

I got it to compile by adding the following lines to build_elua.lua (right near the other tests for things like lualong ).

if bd.get_arch_of_cpu( comp.cpu ) == 'cortexm3' then addcf( { '-mcpu=cortex-m3', '-mthumb' }) dprint(&quot;CortexM3&quot;) end
if bd.get_arch_of_cpu( comp.cpu ) == 'cortexm4' then addcf( { '-mcpu=cortex-m4', '-mthumb' }) dprint(&quot;CortexM4&quot;) end

Not sure if this omission affects other cortex platforms as well.

Took me quite a while to figure out where to add these.
The old build system was a lot easier to add tweaks like this without having to hunt so much.
Would be good to make the code clearer for quick tweaking - making it more obvious where to insert or change compiler arguments, etc.
(No, I don't understand how the old builder worked, and I don't understand the new one either, and I shouldn't have to
just to build the program, or to tell the compiler the options I want used.)

---

One downside of the new build system, it seems to assume that all boards that use the same platform will also use the
same CPU architecture. &#160;The LM4F120 (Stellaris/Tiva launchpad) is a cortex M4 processor, but it uses the
same libraries/platform as the LM3s. &#160;I found the table in build_data.lua, which has the aforementioned assumption
built into it. &#160;How do I add the LM4F120, making it use the LM3s platform, but tell the build system that it is a cortex m4 processor?
Some tweaking of build_data.lua should make it possible to handle this situation gracefully.

Hope this helps
